\v 2 On the fifth \add day\add* of the month—it was the fifth year of the exile of the king Jehoiachin— 
\v 3 the word of Yahweh ⸤came⸥\f + \fr 1:3 \ft Literally “was” \f* clearly\f + \fr 1:3 \ft Or “certainly” \f* to Ezekiel the son of Buzi, the priest, in the land of \add the\add* Chaldeans at the ⸤Kebar River⸥,\f + \fr 1:3 \ft Literally “river of Kebar” \f* and the hand of Yahweh was on him there.

\v 5 And from its midst\f + \fr 1:5 \ft Or “middle” \f* \add was\add* the likeness of four living creatures, and this \add was\add* their appearance: ⸤a human form⸥,\f + \fr 1:5 \ft Literally “this their appearance the likeness of a human to them” \f* 
\v 6 and ⸤each had four faces⸥,\f + \fr 1:6 \ft Literally “and four faces to each” \f* and ⸤each of them had four wings⸥.\f + \fr 1:6 \ft Literally “and four wings to each for them” \f* 
\v 7 And their legs \add were\add* straight legs, and the sole of their feet \add was\add* like the sole of \add the\add* foot of a calf, and \add they\add* were sparkling like the outward appearance of polished bronze. 
\v 8 And under their wings \add were\add* ⸤human hands⸥\f + \fr 1:8 \ft Literally “hand his a man” \f* on their four sides. And their faces and their wings for the four of them \add were as follows\add*: 
\v 9 ⸤their wings were touching one another⸥;\f + \fr 1:9 \ft Literally “their wings \fq were \ft touching each her sister” \f* ⸤each of them went straight forward⸥,\f + \fr 1:9 \ft Literally “they did not turn at their going” \f* ⸤without turning right or left⸥.\f + \fr 1:9 \ft Literally “each toward the side of his face they went” \f*

\v 17 When they moved, they went toward their four sides; they did not ⸤veer at all as they went⸥.\f + \fr 1:17 \ft Literally “turn away when they went” \f* 
\v 18 And their rims ⸤were high and awesome⸥,\f + \fr 1:18 \ft Literally “height \fq was \ft for them and awesomeness \fq was \ft for them” \f* and ⸤all four of⸥\f + \fr 1:18 \ft Literally “of the four of them” \f* their rims \add were\add* full of eyes \add all\add* around. 
\v 19 And at the going of the living creatures, the wheels next to them \add also\add* went, and ⸤when the creatures were lifted from the ground⸥\f + \fr 1:19 \ft Literally “and at the lifting up of the creatures from the earth” \f* the wheels \add also\add* rose. 
\v 20 ⸤Wherever⸥\f + \fr 1:20 \ft Literally “Toward which” \f* the spirit went they would go there, and the wheels rose, for the spirit of the living creatures\f + \fr 1:20 \ft Hebrew “creature” \f* \add was\add* in the wheels.

\p 
\v 22 Now\f + \fr 1:22 \ft Or “And” \f* \add the\add* likeness above the heads of the living creatures \add was\add* an expanse like the outward appearance of ⸤awesome⸥\f + \fr 1:22 \ft Literally “terrible” \f* ⸤ice⸥\f + \fr 1:22 \ft Literally “frozen water” \f* spread out above their heads ⸤upward⸥.\f + \fr 1:22 \ft Literally “from to upward” \f* 
\v 23 And under the expanse their wings \add were stretched out\add* straight ⸤one toward the other⸥;\f + \fr 1:23 \ft Literally “each towards its sister” \f* each had two \add wings\add* covering them, and each had two \add wings\add* covering their bodies. 
\v 24 And I heard the sound of their wings like \add the\add* sound of many waters, like the voice of Shaddai,\f + \fr 1:24 \ft Often translated “Almighty” \f* \add and\add* ⸤when they moved⸥\f + \fr 1:24 \ft Literally “at their going” \f* \add there was\add* a sound of tumult like \add the\add* sound of an army; ⸤when they stood still⸥\f + \fr 1:24 \ft Literally “at their standing” \f* they lowered their wings.

\v 1  And he said to me, “Son of man,\f + \fr 3:1 \ft Or “mortal,” or “son of humankind” \f* what you find, eat! Eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel.” 
\v 2 And I opened my mouth, and he gave me this scroll to eat,

\v 7 And the house of Israel, they are not willing to listen to you, for they \add are\add* not willing to listen to me, for all of the house of Israel is hard of forehead, and they \add are\add* hard of heart. 
\v 8 \add But\add* look, I have made\f + \fr 3:8 \ft Or “set” \f* your face hard ⸤against⸥\f + \fr 3:8 \ft Literally “to correspond \fq to \ft ” \f* their faces and your forehead hard ⸤against⸥\f + \fr 3:8 \ft Literally “to correspond \fq to \ft ” \f* their forehead. 
\v 9 Like a diamond ⸤harder than flint⸥\f + \fr 3:9 \ft Literally “hard more than flint” \f* I have made your forehead; you must not fear them, and you must not be dismayed ⸤on account of them⸥,\f + \fr 3:9 \ft Literally “from the face of them” \f* for they ⸤are a rebellious house⸥.\f + \fr 3:9 \ft Literally “\fq are \ft a house of rebellion” \f*

\v 12 And the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the sound of a great earthquake when the glory of Yahweh rose from its place. 
\v 13 And \add it was\add* the sound of the wings of the living creatures touching lightly\f + \fr 3:13 \ft Or “brushing against” \f* ⸤one against the other⸥,\f + \fr 3:13 \ft Literally “each against each \fq its sister \ft  \f* and the sound of the wheels beside them and \add the\add* sound of a great earthquake.
