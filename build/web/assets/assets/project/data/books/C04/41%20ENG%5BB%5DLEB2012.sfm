\v 8 And immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they were reasoning like this within themselves, said to them, “Why are you considering these \add things\add* in your hearts? 
\v 9 Which is easier to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say ‘Get up and pick up your stretcher and walk’? 
\v 10 But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,”—he said to the paralytic—
\v 11 “I say to you, get up, pick up your stretcher, and go to your home.”
