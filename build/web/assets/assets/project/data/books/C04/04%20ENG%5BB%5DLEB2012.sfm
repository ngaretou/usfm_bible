\s1 The Passover
\m 
\v 1 Yahweh spoke to Moses in the desert of Sinai, in the second year after they came out from the land of Egypt, in the first month, saying, 
\v 2 “Let the ⸤Israelites⸥\f + \fr 9:2 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* observe the Passover at its appointed time. 
\v 3 On the fourteenth day of this month ⸤at twilight⸥\f + \fr 9:3 \ft Literally “between the two evenings” \f* you will perform it at its appointed time according to all its decrees; and according to all its stipulations you will observe it.” 
\v 4 So Moses spoke to the ⸤Israelites⸥\f + \fr 9:4 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* to observe the Passover. 
\v 5 And they observed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month ⸤at twilight⸥\f + \fr 9:5 \ft Literally “between the two evenings” \f* in the desert of Sinai. According to all that Yahweh commanded Moses, thus the ⸤Israelites⸥\f + \fr 9:5 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* did.
\p 
\v 6 And it happened, men who were unclean ⸤by a dead person⸥\f + \fr 9:6 \ft Literally “by a life of a person” \f* were not able to perform the Passover on that day. And they came ⸤before⸥\f + \fr 9:6 \ft Literally “in the presence of” \f* Moses and Aaron on that day. 
\v 7 And those men said to him, “\add Although\add* we \add are\add* unclean ⸤by a dead person⸥,\f + \fr 9:7 \ft Literally “by a life of a person” \f* why are we hindered from presenting the offering of Yahweh at its appointed time in the midst of the ⸤Israelites⸥?”\f + \fr 9:7 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* 
\v 8 Moses said to them, “Stay. I will hear what Yahweh commands to you.”
\p 
\v 9 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 10 “Speak to the ⸤Israelites⸥,\f + \fr 9:10 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* saying, ‘Each man that is unclean ⸤by a dead person⸥\f + \fr 9:10 \ft Literally “by a life of a person” \f* or \add is\add* on a far journey, you or your ⸤descendants⸥,\f + \fr 9:10 \ft Literally “generations” \f* he will observe the Passover of Yahweh. 
\v 11 On the second month on the fourteenth day ⸤at twilight⸥\f + \fr 9:11 \ft Literally “between the two evenings” \f* they will observe it; they will eat it with unleavened bread and bitter plants. 
\v 12 They will leave none of it until morning, and they will not break a bone in it; they will observe it according to every decree of the Passover. 
\v 13 But the man who \add is\add* clean and not on a journey, and he fails to observe the Passover, that person will be cut off from the people because he did not present the offering of Yahweh on its appointed time. That man will bear his guilt. 
\v 14 If an alien dwells with you he will observe the Passover of Yahweh according \add to\add* the decree of the Passover and according \add to\add* its stipulation; thus you will have one decree for you, for the alien and for the native of the land.’ ”
\s1 The Cloud and the Fire

\p 
\v 25 Then the standard of the camp of the descendants\f + \fr 10:25 \ft Or “sons” \f* of Dan, who formed a rear guard for all the camps, set out according to their divisions; Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai \add was\add* over its division.

\p 
\v 29 Moses said to Hobab son of Reuel the Midianite, the father-in-law of Moses, “We \add are\add* setting out to the place that Yahweh said, ‘I will give it to you’; go with us, and we will ⸤treat you well⸥\f + \fr 10:29 \ft Literally “do good to you” \f* because ⸤Yahweh promised⸥\f + \fr 10:29 \ft Literally “Yahweh spoke” \f* good concerning Israel.”

\v 2 Then the people cried out to Moses, and Moses prayed to Yahweh, and the fire died down. 
\v 3 And he called the name of that place Taberah\f + \fr 11:3 \ft This word is difficult, but some modern translations suggest the word in Hebrew means “burning” (see NRSV, NASB) \f* because the fire of Yahweh burned among them.
\p 
\v 4 The riff-raff that \add were\add* in their midst ⸤had a strong desire⸥;\f + \fr 11:4 \ft Literally “desired a desire” \f* and the ⸤Israelites⸥\f + \fr 11:4 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* turned back and also wept, and they said, “Who will feed us meat? 
\v 5 We remember the fish that we ate in Egypt for nothing, the cucumber, melon, leek, the onions, and the garlic.

\v 8 The people went about and gathered \add it\add*, and they ground \add it\add* with mills or crushed \add it\add* with mortar. Then they boiled \add it\add* in a pot and made it \add into\add* bread-cakes; and it tasted like olive oil cakes. 
\v 9 When the dew came down on the camp \add at\add* night, the manna came down \add with\add* it.

\v 10 Moses heard the people weeping according to their\f + \fr 11:10 \ft Hebrew “its” \f* clans, each at the doorway of their tents. Then ⸤Yahweh became very angry⸥,\f + \fr 11:10 \ft Literally “the nose of Yahweh became very hot” \f* and in the eyes of Moses it was bad. 
\v 11 And Moses said to Yahweh, “Why have you brought trouble to your servant? Why have I not found favor in your eyes, that the burdens of all these people have been placed on me? 
\v 12 Did I conceive all these people?

\v 13 From where do I have meat to give all these people? They weep before me, saying, ‘Give us meat and let us eat!’ 
\v 14 I am not able to carry all these people along alone; they are too heavy for me. 
\v 15 If this is how you \add are\add* going to treat me, please kill me immediately if I find favor in your eyes, and do not let me see my misery.”
\p 
\v 16 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Gather for me seventy men from the elders of Israel whom you know \add are\add* elders of the people and their\f + \fr 11:16 \ft Hebrew “his/its” \f* officials; take them to the tent of assembly, and they will stand there with you. 
\v 17 I will come down and speak with you there; I will take away from the spirit that \add is\add* on you, and I will place \add it\add* on them; and they will bear the burdens of the people with you; you will not bear it alone. 
\v 18 And you will say to the people, ‘Sanctify yourselves tomorrow, for you will eat meat because you have wept in the ears of Yahweh, saying, “Who will feed us good meat? \add It was\add* good for us in Egypt.” Yahweh will give to you meat, and you will eat. 
\v 19 You will eat, not one day, or two days, or five days, or ten days, or twenty days,

\v 21 But Moses said, “\add There are\add* six hundred thousand on foot, among whom I \add am\add* in the midst, and you yourself said, ‘I will give meat to them, and they will eat for a whole month.’ 
\v 22 Should flocks and cattle be slaughtered for them? Should all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to be enough for them?” 
\v 23 And Yahweh said to Moses, “⸤Is Yahweh’s power limited⸥?\f + \fr 11:23 \ft Literally “Is Yahweh’s hand short?” \f* Now you will see if my word will happen or not.”
\p 
\v 24 So Moses went out, and he spoke the words of Yahweh to the people, and he gathered \add together\add* seventy men from the elders of the people, and he ⸤made them stand⸥\f + \fr 11:24 \ft Literally “caused them to stand” \f* all around the tent. 
\v 25 Then Yahweh went down in the cloud and spoke to him, and he took away the spirit that \add was\add* on him, and he ⸤put it⸥\f + \fr 11:25 \ft Or “gave it” \f* on the seventy elders. And as soon as the spirit was resting on them they prophesied, but they did not do it again.

\v 26 But two men were left in the camp; the name of one \add was\add* Eldad, and the name of the second \add was\add* Medad, and the spirit rested on them; they were among those who were written \add down\add*, but they did not go out to the tent, so they prophesied in the camp.

\s1 Spies Sent to Spy Out the Land of Canaan

\v 16 These \add are\add* the names of the men whom Moses sent to explore the land. And Moses called Hoshea son of Nun Joshua.
\p 
\v 17 Moses sent them to explore the land of Canaan, and he said to them, “Go up \add like\add* this to the Negev,\f + \fr 13:17 \ft An arid region south of the Judean hills \f* and go up into the hill country,

\p 
\v 21 So they went up and explored the land from the desert of Zin until Rehob, at Lebo Hamath.\f + \fr 13:21 \ft Or “near Hamath” \f*

\v 24 That place he called the valley\f + \fr 13:24 \ft Or “wadi” \f* of Eshcol on account of the cluster of grapes that the ⸤Israelites⸥\f + \fr 13:24 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* cut off from there.

\p 
\v 30 And Caleb silenced the people before Moses and said, “Surely, let us go up and let us take possession of it because surely we will be able to prevail over it.” 
\v 31 And the men who went up with him said, “We are not able to go up to the people because they \add are\add* stronger than us.” 
\v 32 And they presented the report of the land that they explored to the ⸤Israelites⸥,\f + \fr 13:32 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* saying, “The land that we went through to explore \add is\add* a land that eats its inhabitants, and all the people whom we saw in its midst \add are\add* ⸤men of great size⸥.\f + \fr 13:32 \ft Literally “men of measurements” \f*

\p 
\v 36 As for the men whom Moses sent to explore the land, who returned and made the community grumble against him by spreading a report over the land,

\v 11 Therefore you and your company that has banded together against Yahweh. What is Aaron that you grumble against him?”
\p 
\v 12 Moses sent to call \add for\add* Dathan and Abiram son of Eliab, but they said, “We will not come!\f + \fr 16:12 \ft Hebrew “We will not come up!” \f* 
\v 13 Is it too little that you have brought us from a land that flows with milk and honey to kill us in the desert, and that you also appoint yourself as a ruler over us? 
\v 14 Surely, you have not brought us to a land that flows with milk and honey, and you have not given us the inheritance of fields and a vineyard. Will you gouge out the eyes of these men? We will not come!”\f + \fr 16:14 \ft Hebrew “We will not come up!” \f*
\p 
\v 15 Then Moses became angry, and he said to Yahweh, “Do not notice their grain offering. I have not offered one donkey from them, and I have not mistreated one of them.” 
\v 16 And Moses said to Korah, “You and your entire company will be ⸤before⸥\f + \fr 16:16 \ft Literally “in the presence of” \f* Yahweh tomorrow, you and they and Aaron. 
\v 17 Each one take his censer, and put incense on it\f + \fr 16:17 \ft Hebrew “on them” \f* and you will present it ⸤before⸥\f + \fr 16:17 \ft Literally “in the presence of” \f* Yahweh, and each of you bring his censer, two hundred and fifty censers, you and Aaron, each his censer.” 
\v 18 So each of them took his censer, and they put fire on them, and they placed incense on them; they stood \add at the\add* doorway of the tent of the assembly of Moses and Aaron. 
\v 19 And Korah summoned them, the entire community, by the doorway of the tent of assembly, and the glory of Yahweh appeared to all the community.
\p 
\v 20 And Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, 
\v 21 “Separate yourselves from the midst of this community, that I can destroy them in a moment.” 
\v 22 And they fell on their faces, and they said, “God, God of the spirits of all flesh, will one man sin and you become angry toward the entire community?”
\p 
\v 23 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 24 “Speak to the community, saying, ‘Move away from the dwelling of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.’ ” 
\v 25 So Moses stood up and went to Dathan and Abiram; the elders of Israel followed after him. 
\v 26 He said to the community, saying, “Please turn away from the tents of these wicked men, and do not touch anything ⸤that belongs to them⸥,\f + \fr 16:26 \ft Literally “that \fq is \ft to them” \f* or you will be destroyed with all their sins.” 
\v 27 And so they moved away from around the dwellings\f + \fr 16:27 \ft Hebrew “dwelling” \f* of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram; and Dathan and Abiram came out standing \add at\add* the doorway of their tents, with their wives, sons, and little children. 
\v 28 And Moses said, “In this you will know that Yahweh has sent me to do all these works; \add it is\add* not from my heart. 
\v 29 ⸤If they die a natural death⸥\f + \fr 16:29 \ft Literally “If they die like the death of every human” \f* or ⸤if a natural fate is visited upon them⸥,\f + \fr 16:29 \ft Literally “If the fate of every human is visited upon them” \f* Yahweh has not sent me. 
\v 30 But if Yahweh creates something new, and the ground opens its mouth and swallows them up and ⸤all that belongs to them⸥,\f + \fr 16:30 \ft Literally “All that \fq is \ft for them” \f* and they go down alive \add to\add* Sheol, and you will know that these men have despised Yahweh.”
\p 
\v 31 And it happened, as soon as he finished ⸤speaking⸥\f + \fr 16:31 \ft Literally “to speak” \f* all these words, the ground that \add was\add* under them split open. 
\v 32 The land opened its mouth and swallowed them up with their houses and every person ⸤that belonged to Korah⸥\f + \fr 16:32 \ft Literally “that was to Korah” \f* and all the property. 
\v 33 They went down alive \add to\add* Sheol, they and all that belonged to them, and the land covered over them, and they perished from the midst of the assembly. 
\v 34 All Israel who \add were\add* around them fled at their cry, because they said, “Lest the land swallow us up!” 
\v 35 And fire went out from Yahweh, and it consumed the two hundred and fifty men presenting the incense.
\p 
\v 36 \f + \fr 16:36 \ft \xt Numbers 16:36–17:13 \ft in the English Bible is 17:1–28 in the Hebrew Bible \f* And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

\v 39 Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers that the ones who were burned presented, and they hammered them out thinly \add as\add* plating for the altar;

\s1 The Israelites Grumble
\m 
\v 41 The next day all the community of the ⸤Israelites⸥\f + \fr 16:41 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* grumbled against Moses and Aaron, saying, “You have killed the people of Yahweh!” 
\v 42 Then, when the community had gathered against Moses and Aaron, they turned to the tent of assembly, and behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of Yahweh appeared. 
\v 43 And Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of assembly, 
\v 44 and Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
\v 45 “Get away from the midst of this community, and I will finish them in an instant,”\f + \fr 16:45 \ft Or “in a moment” \f* but they fell on their faces. 
\v 46 And Moses and Aaron said, “Take the censer, and put fire on it from the altar. Place incense \add on it\add*, and bring it quickly to the community, and make atonement for them, because wrath went out from the presence of Yahweh, and a plague has begun.” 
\v 47 And so Aaron took \add it\add* just as Moses had spoken, and he ran into the midst of the assembly, for behold, the plague had begun among the people; so he gave the incense and made atonement for the people. 
\v 48 He stood between the dead and between the living, and the plague was stopped. 
\v 49 Those who died by the plague were fourteen thousand seven hundred, besides those who died on account of Korah. 
\v 50 Then Aaron returned to Moses at the doorway of the tent of assembly, and the plague was stopped.

\s1 Aaron’s Staff Is Chosen

\v 1 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

\s1 The Duties of the Priests and Levities

\v 1 Yahweh said to Aaron, “You, your sons, and your family with you will bear the guilt of the sanctuary, and you and your sons with you will bear the guilt of your priesthood. 
\v 2 Moreover, bring your brothers with you, the tribe of Levi the tribe of your father, that they may be joined to you and minister \add to\add* you, you and your sons with you before the tent of testimony. 
\v 3 They will keep your responsibility and the responsibility of all the tent, only they may not come near the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar, so both you and they will not die.

\v 6 Look, I myself have chosen your brothers the Levites from the midst of the children. They are a gift to you given from Yahweh to perform the work of the tent of assembly.

\v 19 The ⸤Israelites⸥\f + \fr 20:19 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* said to him, “We will go up on the main road, and if we\f + \fr 20:19 \ft Hebrew “I” \f* and our livestock\f + \fr 20:19 \ft Hebrew “my livestock” \f* drink your water, we will pay \add for it\add*.\f + \fr 20:19 \ft Hebrew “I will give their worth” \f* It is only a small matter; let us pass through on our feet.”\f + \fr 20:19 \ft Hebrew “I will go through on my feet” \f* 
\v 20 But he said, “You will not go through.” And Edom went out to meet ⸤them⸥\f + \fr 20:20 \ft Hebrew “him” \f* with a large army and a strong hand. 
\v 21 So Edom refused to give Israel passage through his territory, and Israel turned aside from him.
\s1 Aaron Dies
\m 
\v 22 And they set out from Kadesh. The ⸤Israelites⸥,\f + \fr 20:22 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* the whole community, came \add to\add* Mount Hor. 
\v 23 Yahweh said to Moses and to Aaron on Mount Hor, on the boundary of the land of Edom, saying, 
\v 24 “Let Aaron be gathered to his people; he will not come into the land that I have given to the ⸤Israelites⸥\f + \fr 20:24 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* because you rebelled against ⸤my word⸥\f + \fr 20:24 \ft Literally “my mouth” \f* at the waters of Meribah. 
\v 25 Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and take them up Mount Hor. 
\v 26 Strip off Aaron’s garments, and put them on Eleazar his son; Aaron will be gathered \add to his people\add*, and he will die there.” 
\v 27 So Moses did just as Yahweh commanded, and they went up to Mount Hor before the eyes of all the community. 
\v 28 And Moses stripped off Aaron’s garments and put them on Eleazar his son. Aaron died there on the top of the mountain; and Moses and Eleazar went down from the mountain. 
\v 29 All the community saw that Aaron died; so all the house of Israel wept for Aaron thirty days.\f + \fr 20:29 \ft Hebrew “day” \f*
\c 21
\s1 Arad Captured
\m 
\v 1 The Canaanite king of Arad, who was dwelling \add in\add* the Negev,\f + \fr 21:1 \ft An arid region south of the Judean hills \f* heard that Israel came \add along\add* the way of Atharim; he fought against Israel and took some of them captive. 
\v 2 Israel made a vow to Yahweh, and they said, “If you will surely give this people into our\f + \fr 21:2 \ft Hebrew “my” \f* hand, then we\f + \fr 21:2 \ft Hebrew “I” \f* ⸤will destroy⸥\f + \fr 21:2 \ft Literally “devote to God” \f* their cities.” 
\v 3 Yahweh heard the voice of Israel; he gave \add to them\add* the Canaanites, and ⸤they destroyed them⸥\f + \fr 21:3 \ft Literally “they devoted to God” \f* and their cities. They called the name of the place Hormah.
\p 
\v 4 They set out from Mount Hor \add by\add* the way of the ⸤Red Sea⸥\f + \fr 21:4 \ft Literally “sea of reed” \f* to go around the land of Edom; but ⸤the people became impatient⸥\f + \fr 21:4 \ft Literally “the life of the people became short” \f* along the way. 
\v 5 The people spoke against God and against Moses, “Why have you brought us from Egypt to die in the desert? There is no food and no water, and our hearts detest \add this\add* miserable food.”
\s1 The Bronze Serpent
\m 
\v 6 And Yahweh sent among the people poisonous snakes; they bit the people, and many people from Israel died. 
\v 7 The people came to Moses and said, “We have sinned because we have spoken against Yahweh and against you. Pray to Yahweh and let him remove the snakes\f + \fr 21:7 \ft Hebrew “snake” \f* from among us.” So Moses prayed for the people. 
\v 8 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Make for yourself a snake and place it on a pole. When\f + \fr 21:8 \ft Hebrew “And it will happen” \f* anyone is bitten and looks at it, that person will live.” 
\v 9 So Moses made a snake of bronze, and he placed it on the pole; whenever\f + \fr 21:9 \ft Hebrew “And it will happen” \f* a snake bit someone, and that person looked at the snake of bronze, he lived.
\p 
\v 10 The ⸤Israelites⸥\f + \fr 21:10 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* set out and encamped at Oboth. 
\v 11 They set out from Oboth and encamped at Iye Abarim in the desert, which \add was\add* in front of Moab ⸤toward the sunrise⸥.\f + \fr 21:11 \ft Literally “from the east of the sun” \f* 
\v 12 From there they set out and encamped at the valley of Zered. 
\v 13 From there they set out and encamped beyond Arnon, which \add is\add* in the desert that goes out from the boundary of the Amorites,\f + \fr 21:13 \ft Hebrew “Amorite” \f* because Arnon \add is\add* the boundary of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.\f + \fr 21:13 \ft Hebrew “Amorite” \f* 
\v 14 Therefore thus it is said in the scroll of the Wars of Yahweh,
\sd0
\q1 “Waheb in Suphah,
\q2 and the wadis of Arnon,
\q1 
\v 15 and the slope of the wadis
\q2 that spreads out to the dwelling of Ar
\q1 and lies at the boundary of Moab.”
\sd0
\p 
\v 16 From there \add they went\add* to Beer, which is the water well where Yahweh spoke to Moses, “Gather the people, that I may give them water.” 
\v 17 Then Israel sang this song, “Arise, well water! Sing to it! 
\v 18 Well water that the princes dug, that the leaders of the people dug, with a staff \add and\add* with their rods.” And from \add the\add* desert \add they continued to\add* Mattanah, 
\v 19 and from Mattanah \add to\add* Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel \add to\add* Bamoth; 
\v 20 and from Bamoth to the valley that \add is\add* in the territory of Moab, \add by\add* the top of Pisgah, which overlooks the surface of the wasteland.
\s1 Sihon and Og Defeated
\m 
\v 21 Israel sent messengers to Sihon, the king of the Amorites,\f + \fr 21:21 \ft Hebrew “Amorite” \f* saying, 
\v 22 “Let us go through your land; we will not turn aside into a field or vineyard; we will not drink well water along the way of the king until we have gone through your territory.” 
\v 23 But Sihon did not allow Israel to go through his territory. Sihon gathered all his people and went out to meet Israel; he came \add to\add* the desert, to Jahaz, and he fought against Israel. 
\v 24 But Israel struck him with \add the\add* edge of \add the\add* sword, and they took possession of his land from Arnon to Jabbok, until the ⸤Ammonites⸥,\f + \fr 21:24 \ft Literally “sons of Ammon” \f* because the boundary of the ⸤Ammonites⸥\f + \fr 21:24 \ft Literally “sons of Ammon” \f* \add was\add* strong. 
\v 25 Israel took all these cities, and Israel inhabited all the cities of the Amorites,\f + \fr 21:25 \ft Hebrew “Amorite” \f* in Heshbon, and in all its environs.\f + \fr 21:25 \ft Hebrew “her daughters;” other modern versions translate “its villages” \f* 
\v 26 Because Heshbon \add was\add* the city of Sihon king of the Amorites,\f + \fr 21:26 \ft Hebrew “Amorite” \f* who had fought against the former king of Moab and taken all his land from his hand until Arnon. 
\v 27 Thus the ones who quote proverbs say,
\sd0
\q1 “Come \add to\add* Heshbon! Let it be built!
\q2 And let the city of Sihon be established.
\q1 
\v 28 Because fire went out from Heshbon,
\q2 a flame from the city of Sihon;
\q1 it consumed Ar of Moab,
\q2 the lords of the\f + \fr 21:28 \ft Or “the dominant” \f* high places of Arnon.
\q1 
\v 29 Woe to you, Moab!
\q2 You have perished, people of Chemosh.
\q1 He has given his sons as fugitives,
\q2 and his daughters into captivity,
\q1 to the king of the Amorites,\f + \fr 21:29 \ft Hebrew “Amorite” \f* Sihon.
\q2 
\v 30 We destroyed them;
\q1 Heshbon has perished up to Dibon;
\q2 we laid waste up to Nophah,
\q1 which ⸤reaches⸥\f + \fr 21:30 \ft Literally “\fq is \ft up to” \f* Medeba.”
\sd0
\p 
\v 31 Thus Israel lived in the land of the Amorites.\f + \fr 21:31 \ft Hebrew “Amorite” \f* 
\v 32 Moses sent to explore Jaazer; they captured ⸤its environs⸥\f + \fr 21:32 \ft Hebrew “her daughters;” other modern versions translate “its villages” \f* and dispossessed the Amorites\f + \fr 21:32 \ft Hebrew “Amorite” \f* who \add were\add* there.
\p 
\v 33 Then they turned and went up \add by\add* the way of the Bashan, and Og king of the Bashan and all his people went out to meet them for battle \add at\add* Edrei. 
\v 34 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Do not fear him because I will give him and all his people and all his land into your hand. You will do to him just as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites,\f + \fr 21:34 \ft Hebrew “Amorite” \f* who was living in Heshbon.” 
\v 35 And so they destroyed him and his sons, and all his people until they had not spared a survivor; and they took possession of his land.
\c 22
\s1 Balak and Balaam
\m 
\v 1 The ⸤Israelites⸥\f + \fr 22:1 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* set out, and they encamped on the desert-plateau of Moab, across from Jericho beyond \add the\add* Jordan. 
\v 2 Balak son of Zippor saw all that Israel did to the Amorites,\f + \fr 22:2 \ft Hebrew “Amorite” \f* 
\v 3 and Moab was very terrified in the presence of the people because ⸤they⸥\f + \fr 22:3 \ft Hebrew “he” or “it” \f* \add were\add* numerous; and Moab dreaded the presence of the ⸤Israelites⸥.\f + \fr 22:3 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* 
\v 4 And Moab said to the elders of Midian, “Now the crowd will lick up all around us, like a bull devours the grass of the field.” And Balak son of Zippor \add was\add* king of Moab at that time. 
\v 5 He sent messengers to Balaam son of Beor \add at\add* Pethor, which \add is\add* by the river,\f + \fr 22:5 \ft That is, the Euphrates \f* in the land of the children of his people, to summon him, saying, “Look! A people went out from Egypt. Look! They cover ⸤the surface of the land⸥;\f + \fr 22:5 \ft Literally “the eye of the land” \f* they \add are about\add* to dwell opposite me. 
\v 6 Now, please go, curse this people for me because they\f + \fr 22:6 \ft Hebrew “he” \f* \add are\add* stronger than me; perhaps I will be able to strike them\f + \fr 22:6 \ft Hebrew “he” \f* and drive them\f + \fr 22:6 \ft Hebrew “he” \f* out from the land because I know whoever you bless \add is\add* blessed, and whoever you cursed is cursed.”
\p 
\v 7 So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian went \add with\add* a fee for divination in their hand; they came to Balaam and spoke the words of Balak to him. 
\v 8 He said to them, “Spend the night here, and I will return, and I will return word to you, just as Yahweh speaks to me.” So the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam. 
\v 9 And God came to Balaam and said, “Who \add are\add* these men with you?” 
\v 10 And Balaam said to God, “Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, sent \add word\add* to me, 
\v 11 ‘Look! A people went out from Egypt. Look! They cover ⸤the surface of the land⸥.\f + \fr 22:11 \ft Literally “the eye of the land” \f* Now, go, curse them\f + \fr 22:11 \ft Hebrew “him” \f* for me. Perhaps I will be able to attack them\f + \fr 22:11 \ft Hebrew “him” \f* and drive them\f + \fr 22:11 \ft Hebrew “him” \f* out.” 
\v 12 God said to Balaam, “You will not go with them; you will not curse the people, because they\f + \fr 22:12 \ft Hebrew “he” \f* \add are\add* blessed.” 
\v 13 Balaam got up in the morning, and he said to the princes of Balak, “Go to your land, because Yahweh refused to allow me to go with you.” 
\v 14 The princes of Moab got up and went to Balak, and they said, “Balaam refused to come with us.”
\p 
\v 15 Balak again sent many princes, \add who were more\add* honored ⸤than the former⸥.\f + \fr 22:15 \ft Literally “than these” \f* 
\v 16 They came to Balaam and said to him, “Thus says Balak son of Zippor, ‘Please, let nothing keep you from coming to me 
\v 17 because I will surely honor you greatly, and all that you say to me I will do. Please, come; curse this people for me.’ ” 
\v 18 Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, “Even though Balak gives to me his house full of silver and gold, I am not able to go beyond ⸤the command of Yahweh⸥\f + \fr 22:18 \ft Literally “the mouth of Yahweh” \f* my God to do a little or a lot. 
\v 19 And now please, ⸤you also stay here⸥\f + \fr 22:19 \ft Literally “please stay in this” \f* the night, and ⸤let me find out⸥\f + \fr 22:19 \ft Literally “let me know” \f* again what Yahweh will say with me.” 
\v 20 And God came to Balaam \add at\add* night, and he said to him, “If the men have come to call you, get up \add and\add* go with them; but only the word that I will speak to you, you will do.” 
\v 21 So Balaam got up in the morning and saddled his donkey, and he went with the princes of Moab.
\s1 Balaam and the Angel
\m 
\v 22 But ⸤God became angry⸥\f + \fr 22:22 \ft Literally “God’s nose became hot” \f* because he was going, and the angel of Yahweh stood in the road as an adversary to him; he \add was\add* riding on his donkey, and two servants were with him. 
\v 23 The donkey saw the angel of Yahweh standing in the road with his sword drawn in his hand, and the donkey turned aside from the road and went into the field. And Balaam struck the donkey to turn her back \add to\add* the road. 
\v 24 The angel of Yahweh stood in the narrow path of the vineyards, \add with\add* ⸤a wall on either side⸥.\f + \fr 22:24 \ft Literally “a wall from this and a wall from this” \f* 
\v 25 When the donkey saw the angel of Yahweh, she pressed herself into the wall, and she pressed the foot of Balaam into the wall, so he struck her again. 
\v 26 Then the angel of Yahweh went further ahead and stood in a narrow place where there was not a way to turn aside \add to the\add* right or left. 
\v 27 When the donkey saw the angel of Yahweh, she lay down under Balaam, so ⸤Balaam became angry⸥,\f + \fr 22:27 \ft Literally “Balaam’s nose became hot” \f* and he struck the donkey with \add his\add* staff. 
\v 28 Yahweh opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, “What did I do to you that you struck me these three times?” 
\v 29 Balaam said to the donkey, “Because you made a mockery of me! If only I had a sword in my hand, I would kill you right now!” 
\v 30 The donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your donkey on which you have ridden all your life until this day? Have I been in the habit of doing this to you?” He said, “No.”
\p 
\v 31 Then Yahweh exposed the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of Yahweh standing in the road with his sword drawn in his hand, and he bowed down and worshiped to his face. 
\v 32 The angel of Yahweh said to him, “Why have you struck this donkey three times? Look, I have come out as an adversary because your conduct is perverse before me. 
\v 33 The donkey saw me and turned aside from me these three times. If she had not turned aside from my face, then I would have killed you and kept her alive.” 
\v 34 Balaam said to the angel of Yahweh, “I have sinned because I did not know that you \add were\add* standing to meet me in the road. Now, ⸤if it is displeasing to you⸥,\f + \fr 22:34 \ft Literally “if it is evil in your eyes” \f* I will turn back.” 
\v 35 The angel of Yahweh said to Balaam, “Go with the men, but speak only the word that I will speak to you.” So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.
\p 
\v 36 When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him by the city of Moab, which \add was\add* on the boundary of Aaron at the end of the territory. 
\v 37 And Balak said to Balaam, “Did I not urgently send to meet with you? Why did you not come to me? Am I really not able to honor you?” 
\v 38 Balaam said to Balak, “Look, I came to you now. Am I really able to speak anything at all? I speak the word that God puts in my mouth.” 
\v 39 Balaam went with Balak, and they came \add to\add* Kiriath-Huzoth. 
\v 40 And Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and he sent \add them\add* to Balaam and to the princes who \add were\add* with him. 
\v 41 And it happened, in the morning Balak took Balaam and took him up to Bamoth-Baal, and he saw from there the end of the nation.

\s1 Balaam’s Oracles
\m 
\v 1 Balaam said to Balak, “Build for me this: seven altars. And prepare for me this: seven bulls and seven rams.” 
\v 2 And Balak did just as Balaam spoke, and Balak offered Balaam a bull and a ram on the altar. 
\v 3 And Balaam said to Balak, “Station yourself at your burnt offering, and I will go; perhaps Yahweh will come to meet me, and whatever he shows me I will tell to you.” So he went \add to\add* a barren height.
\p 
\v 4 And God met with Balaam, and he said to him, “I have arranged seven altars, and I have offered a bull and a ram on the altar.” 
\v 5 Yahweh put a word in the mouth of Balaam and said, “Return to Balak, and you must speak thus.” 
\v 6 So he returned to him, and behold, he was standing beside his burnt offering, he and all the leaders of Moab. 
\v 7 And he lifted up his oracle and said,
\sd0
\q1 “From Aram Balak lead me,
\q2 from the mountains of the east the king of Moab,
\q1 ‘Go for me, curse Jacob,
\q2 and go, denounce Israel.’
\q1 
\v 8 How can I curse \add whom\add* God has not cursed,
\q2 and how can I denounce \add whom\add* Yahweh has not denounced?
\q1 
\v 9 Because from the top of \add the\add* rocks I see him,
\q2 from hilltops I watch him.
\q1 Behold, a people \add who\add* dwell alone,
\q2 they do not consider themselves among the nations.
\q1 
\v 10 Who can count the dust of Jacob,
\q2 or \add as\add* a number the fourth part of Israel?
\q1 Let my life die the death of an upright person,
\q2 and let my end be like his!”
\sd0
\p 
\v 11 And Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and look, you have surely blessed them!” 
\v 12 He answered and said, “⸤Should I not speak⸥\f + \fr 23:12 \ft Literally “Should I not observe to speak” \f* what Yahweh puts in my mouth?”
\p 
\v 13 Then Balak said, “Please walk with me to another place where you will see them, \add but\add* you will only see part of them and will not see all of them; and curse them for me from there.” 
\v 14 So he took him to the field of Zophim to the top of Pisgah, and he built seven altars, and he offered a bull and a ram on \add each\add* altar. 
\v 15 Balaam\f + \fr 23:15 \ft Hebrew “He” \f* said to Balak, “Station yourself here at the burnt offering while I myself meet with \add Yahweh\add* there.” 
\v 16 Then Yahweh met with Balaam, and he put a word in his mouth, and he said, “Return to Balak, and you must speak thus.” 
\v 17 He came to him, and behold, he \add was\add* standing at his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said to him, “What has Yahweh spoken?” 
\v 18 Then ⸤he uttered⸥\f + \fr 23:18 \ft Literally “he lifted up” \f* his oracle, and said,
\sd0
\q1 “Stand up, Balak, and hear;
\q2 listen to me, son of Zippor!
\q1 
\v 19 God \add is\add* not a man, that he should lie,
\q2 nor a son of humankind,
\q1 that he should change his mind.
\q2 Has he said, and will he not do \add it\add*?
\q1 And has he spoken, and will he not fulfill it?
\q2 
\v 20 Behold, I have received \add a command\add* to bless;
\q1 when he has blessed, I cannot cause it to return.
\q2 
\v 21 He has no regard \add for\add* evil in Jacob,
\q1 and he does not see trouble in Israel;
\q2 Yahweh his God \add is\add* with him,

\q2 
\v 22 God, who brings them out from Egypt,

\q2 
\v 23 Because \add there is\add* no sorcery against Jacob,

\q1 
\v 24 Look! \add the\add* people will rise like the lion;
\q2 he raises himself and will not lie down
\q1 until he eats \add the\add* prey
\q2 and drinks the blood of the slain.”
\sd0
\p 
\v 25 Then Balak said to Balaam, “Do not curse them\f + \fr 23:25 \ft Hebrew “him” \f* at all, nor bless them\f + \fr 23:25 \ft Hebrew “him” \f* at all!” 
\v 26 But Balaam answered and said to Balak, “Did I not speak to you, saying, ‘Whatever Yahweh speaks I will do’?”
\p 
\v 27 Then Balak said to Balaam, “Please, come, I will take you to another place; perhaps ⸤it will be acceptable to⸥\f + \fr 23:27 \ft Literally “it will be right in the eyes of” \f* God, and you will curse for me from there.” 
\v 28 So Balak took Balaam \add to\add* the top of Peor, which looks down on the face of the Jeshimon.\f + \fr 23:28 \ft Or “the wasteland” \f* 
\v 29 And Balaam said to Balak, “Build for me these seven altars, and prepare for me these seven bulls and seven rams.” 
\v 30 Balak did just as Balaam said, and he offered a bull and a ram on \add each\add* altar.
\c 24
\s1 Balaam Continues to Utter Oracles
\m 
\v 1 And Balaam saw that ⸤it pleased⸥\f + \fr 24:1 \ft Literally “it was good in the eyes of Yahweh” \f* Yahweh to bless Israel, and he did not go ⸤as other times⸥\f + \fr 24:1 \ft Literally “as time on time” \f* ⸤to seek out⸥\f + \fr 24:1 \ft Literally “to meet” \f* sorcery; instead, he set his face toward the desert.

\v 4 A thousand from each tribe of every tribe of Israel you will send to battle.” 
\v 5 So theywere assigned from the thousands of Israel, a thousand from each tribe, twelve thousand equipped for battle. 
\v 6 Moses sent them, a thousand from each tribe, to the battle, and Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest to the battle with them, and the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets of the blast \add were\add* in his hand.

\v 8 They killed the kings of Midian in addition to the ones they had slain: Evi and Rekem and Zur and Hur and Reba, the five kings of Midian; they also killed Balaam son of Beor by the sword. 
\v 9 The ⸤Israelites⸥\f + \fr 31:9 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* took captive the women of Midian and their children, and they plundered all their domestic animals and all their livestock and all their wealth.

\v 14 But Moses was angry toward the leaders of the troops, the commanders of the thousands and the commanders of the hundreds, who came from the battle of the war. 
\v 15 And Moses said to them, “You have kept alive every female? 
\v 16 Behold, these women ⸤caused⸥\f + \fr 31:16 \ft Literally “were to” \f* the ⸤Israelites⸥,\f + \fr 31:16 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* by the word of Balaam, to be in apostasy against Yahweh in the matter of Peor, so that the plague was among the community of Yahweh.

\v 20 You will purify yourselves and every garment and every object of hide and all the work of goats’ hair, and every object of wood.”
\p 
\v 21 Then Eleazar the priest said to the men of the battle who came from the war, “This \add is\add* the decree of the law that Yahweh commanded Moses. 
\v 22 Only the gold and the silver, the bronze, the iron, the tin, and the lead—
\v 23 everything that will go through the fire—you will pass through the fire, and it will be clean, and only in waters of impurity will it be purified. Whatever does not go into the fire you will pass through the waters. 
\v 24 And you will wash your garments on the seventh day and be clean, and afterward you will come into the camp.”
\s1 Division of the War-Booty

\p 
\v 48 Then the leaders of the thousands of the army, the commanders of the thousands and the commanders of the hundreds, approached Moses, 
\v 49 and they said to Moses, “Your servants have ⸤taken count⸥\f + \fr 31:49 \ft Literally “lifted up the head” \f* of the men of war who \add were\add* ⸤in our charge⸥,\f + \fr 31:49 \ft Literally “in our hand” \f* and no man is missing from us.

\v 6 But Moses said to the descendants\f + \fr 32:6 \ft Or “sons” \f* of Gad and to the descendants\f + \fr 32:6 \ft Or “sons” \f* of Reuben, “Will your brothers go to war while you yourselves live here? 
\v 7 Why are you discouraging the hearts of the ⸤Israelites⸥\f + \fr 32:7 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* from crossing into the land that Yahweh gave to them? 
\v 8 This is what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to see the land. 
\v 9 When they went up to the valley\f + \fr 32:9 \ft Or “the wadi” \f* of Eshcol and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the ⸤Israelites⸥\f + \fr 32:9 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* so that they did not come to the land that Yahweh gave to them. 
\v 10 So ⸤Yahweh’s anger burned⸥\f + \fr 32:10 \ft Literally “Yahweh’s nose became hot” \f* on that day, and he swore an oath, saying, 
\v 11 ‘The men who went up from Egypt, from ⸤those twenty years old⸥\f + \fr 32:11 \ft Literally “a son of twenty years” \f* and above, will not see the land that I swore with an oath to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob because they have not wholly followed me, 
\v 12 except Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun, because they followed Yahweh wholly.’ 
\v 13 And ⸤Yahweh became angry⸥,\f + \fr 32:13 \ft Literally “Yahweh’s nose became hot” \f* and he made them wander in the desert forty years until the entire generation who did evil in the ⸤sight of Yahweh⸥\f + \fr 32:13 \ft Literally “eyes of Yahweh” \f* ⸤had died⸥.\f + \fr 32:13 \ft Literally “had completed” \f* 
\v 14 Behold, you stand in the place of your fathers, a brood of sinful men, to increase still more ⸤Yahweh’s fierce anger⸥\f + \fr 32:14 \ft Literally “the fierce anger of Yahweh’s nose” \f* against Israel. 
\v 15 If you turn from following him, he will again abandon them\f + \fr 32:15 \ft Hebrew “him” \f* in the wilderness, and you would have destroyed all these people.”
\p 
\v 16 They came near to him and said, “We will build sheep pens here for \add the\add* flock of our livestock and cities for our little children;

\v 19 For we will not take possession with them from across the Jordan and beyond because our inheritance has come to us from across the Jordan to the east.”
\p 
\v 20 So Moses said to them, “If you do this thing, if you arm yourselves ⸤before⸥\f + \fr 32:20 \ft Literally “in the presence of” \f* Yahweh for the war,

\v 23 But if you do not do so, behold, you have sinned against Yahweh, and know that your sin will find you. 
\v 24 Build for yourselves cities for your little children and sheep pens for your flocks; what has gone out from your mouth you will do.”
\p 
\v 25 So the descendants\f + \fr 32:25 \ft Or “sons” \f* of Gad and the descendants\f + \fr 32:25 \ft Or “sons” \f* of Reuben said to Moses, saying, “Your servants will do just as my lord commands.

\v 30 But if they will not cross over with you armed, they will acquire land in your midst in Canaan.” 
\v 31 The descendants\f + \fr 32:31 \ft Or “sons” \f* of Gad and the descendants of Reuben answered and said, “What Yahweh has commanded your servants, we will do.

\v 37 The descendants\f + \fr 32:37 \ft Or “sons” \f* of Reuben rebuilt Heshbon, Elealeh, and Kiriathaim,

\v 39 The descendants\f + \fr 32:39 \ft Or “sons” \f* of Makir son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and they captured it and drove out the Amorites\f + \fr 32:39 \ft Hebrew “Amorite” \f* who \add were\add* in it. 
\v 40 So Moses gave Gilead to Makir son of Manasseh, and he lived in it.

\v 5 Then Moses commanded the ⸤Israelites⸥\f + \fr 36:5 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* by the command of Yahweh, saying, “The tribe of the descendants\f + \fr 36:5 \ft Or “sons” \f* of Joseph \add is\add* right \add regarding what they are\add* speaking. 
\v 6 This \add is\add* the word that Yahweh commanded the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, ‘⸤Let them marry⸥\f + \fr 36:6 \ft Literally “Let them be as wives” \f* ⸤whomever they like⸥;\f + \fr 36:6 \ft Literally “they will be as the good in their eyes” \f* only ⸤they must marry⸥\f + \fr 36:6 \ft Literally “they must be as wives” \f* from within the clan of the tribe of their father. 
\v 7 Thus an inheritance of the ⸤Israelites⸥\f + \fr 36:7 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* will not go around from tribe to tribe. Rather, the inheritance of each tribe of his father will remain with the ⸤Israelites⸥.\f + \fr 36:7 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* 
\v 8 Every daughter who possesses an inheritance from the tribes of the ⸤Israelites⸥\f + \fr 36:8 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* will ⸤marry⸥\f + \fr 36:8 \ft Literally “be a wife to” \f* one of the clan of the tribe of her father, so that the ⸤Israelites⸥\f + \fr 36:8 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* will possess the inheritance of his ancestors.\f + \fr 36:8 \ft Or “fathers” \f* 
\v 9 Therefore an inheritance will not go around from \add one\add* tribe to another tribe because the tribes of the ⸤Israelites⸥\f + \fr 36:9 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* will each hold to their \add own\add* inheritance.’ ”
\p 
\v 10 Just as Yahweh commanded to Moses, so the daughters of Zelophehad did: 
\v 11 Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, ⸤married⸥\f + \fr 36:11 \ft Literally “were as wives to” \f* the sons of their uncles. 
\v 12 ⸤They married⸥\f + \fr 36:12 \ft Literally “They were as wives to” \f* those from the sons of Manasseh son of Joseph, and their inheritance ⸤remained⸥\f + \fr 36:12 \ft Literally “was” \f* among the tribe of the clan of their ancestors.\f + \fr 36:12 \ft Or “fathers” \f*
\p 
\v 13 These \add were\add* the commands and the stipulations that Yahweh commanded by the hand of Moses\f + \fr 36:13 \ft Or “through Moses” \f* to the ⸤Israelites⸥\f + \fr 36:13 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* on the desert-plateaus of Moab by the Jordan \add across\add* Jericho.
