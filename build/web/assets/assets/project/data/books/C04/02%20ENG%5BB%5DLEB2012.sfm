\s1 Israel and Oppression in Egypt
\m 
\v 1 And these \add are\add* the names of the sons of Israel who came \add to\add* Egypt; with Jacob, they each came with his ⸤family⸥:\f + \fr 1:1 \ft Literally “house” \f* 
\v 2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah; 
\v 3 Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin; 
\v 4 Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher. 
\v 5 And ⸤all those who descended from Jacob⸥\f + \fr 1:5 \ft Literally “every soul/individual/life, the ones going out from the loins of Jacob” \f* were seventy individuals,\f + \fr 1:5 \ft Or “souls,” “lives” \f* and Joseph was in Egypt. 
\v 6 And Joseph died and all of his brothers and all of that generation. 
\v 7 And the ⸤Israelites⸥\f + \fr 1:7 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* were fruitful and multiplied and were many and were very, very numerous, and the land was filled with them.
\p 
\v 8 And a new king rose over Egypt who did not know Joseph. 
\v 9 And he said to his people, “Look, the people of the ⸤Israelites⸥\f + \fr 1:9 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* \add are\add* greater and more numerous than us. 
\v 10 Come, we must deal shrewdly with them, lest they become many, and when war happens, they also will join our enemies and will fight against us and go up from the land.” 
\v 11 And they appointed commanders of forced labor over them in order to oppress them with their ⸤forced labor⸥,\f + \fr 1:11 \ft Literally “burdens” or “burdensome labor” \f* and they built storage cities for Pharaoh—Pithom and Rameses. 
\v 12 And as he oppressed them, so they became many, and so they spread out, and \add the Egyptians\add* were afraid because of the presence of the ⸤Israelites⸥.\f + \fr 1:12 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* 
\v 13 And the Egyptians ruthlessly compelled the ⸤Israelites⸥\f + \fr 1:13 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* to work. 
\v 14 And they made their lives bitter with hard work with mortar and with bricks and with all \add sorts\add* of work in the field—with all their work in which they ruthlessly enslaved them.
\p 
\v 15 And the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives—of whom the name of the one \add was\add* Shiphrah and the name of the second \add was\add* Puah—
\v 16 and he said, “When you help the Hebrews give birth, you will look upon the pairs of testicles; if he \add is\add* a son, you will put him to death, and if she \add is\add* a daughter, she will live.” 
\v 17 But the midwives feared God, and they did not do as the king of Egypt had said to them. They let the boys live. 
\v 18 And the king of Egypt summoned the midwives, and he said to them, “Why have you done this thing and let the boys live?” 
\v 19 And the midwives said to Pharaoh, “Because the Hebrew \add women are\add* not like the Egyptian women, because they \add are\add* vigorous; before the midwife comes to them, they have given birth.” 
\v 20 And God did the midwives good, and the \add Israelite\add* people became many and were very numerous. 
\v 21 ⸤And so⸥\f + \fr 1:21 \ft Literally “and he/it was” \f* because the midwives feared God, he gave them ⸤families⸥.\f + \fr 1:21 \ft Literally “houses” \f* 
\v 22 And Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, “Every son who is born you will throw into the Nile, and every daughter you will let live.”
\c 2
\s1 The Birth and Early Life of Moses
\m 
\v 1 And a man from the ⸤family⸥\f + \fr 2:1 \ft Literally “house” \f* of Levi went, and he took ⸤a descendent of Levi⸥.\f + \fr 2:1 \ft Literally “daughter of Levi” \f* 
\v 2 And the woman conceived, and she gave birth to a son, and she saw him, that he was a fine baby, and she hid him three months. 
\v 3 But when she could no longer hide him, she got a papyrus basket for him, and she coated it with tar and with pitch, and she placed the boy in it, and she placed \add it\add* among the reeds on the bank of the Nile. 
\v 4 And his sister stood at a distance to know what would be done to him. 
\v 5 And the daughter of Pharaoh went down to wash at the Nile, \add while\add* her maidservants were walking alongside the Nile, and she saw the basket in the midst of the reeds, and she sent her slave woman \add for it\add* and took it 
\v 6 and opened \add it\add* and saw him—the boy—and it was a lad weeping, and she had compassion for him and said, “This \add must be\add* from the boys of the Hebrews.”\f + \fr 2:6 \ft Each instance of the implied “she” in verses 5 and 6 is the daughter of Pharaoh \f* 
\v 7 And his sister said to the daughter of Pharaoh, “Shall I go and call for you a woman from the Hebrews \add who is\add* nursing \add so that\add* she will nurse the boy for you?” 
\v 8 And the daughter of Pharaoh said to her, “Go.” And the girl went, and she called the mother of the boy. 
\v 9 And the daughter of Pharaoh said, “Take this boy and nurse him for me, and I myself will give you wages, and the woman took the boy, and she nursed him. 
\v 10 And the boy grew, and she brought him to the daughter of Pharaoh, and he became her son, and she called his name Moses, and she said, “Because I drew him out from the water.”
\p 
\v 11 ⸤And then⸥\f + \fr 2:11 \ft Literally “and he/it was” \f* in those days when Moses had grown up, he went out to his brothers, and he saw their ⸤forced labor⸥,\f + \fr 2:11 \ft Literally “burdens” or “burdensome labor” \f* and he saw an Egyptian man striking a Hebrew man, \add one of\add* his brothers.\f + \fr 2:11 \ft Or “a Hebrew man from his brothers” \f* 
\v 12 And he turned here and there, and he saw no one,\f + \fr 2:12 \ft Literally “and he saw that there was not a man” \f* and he struck the Egyptian, and he hid him in the sand. 
\v 13 And he went out on the second day, and there were two Hebrew men fighting, and he said to the guilty \add one\add*, “Why do you strike your neighbor?” 
\v 14 And he said, “Who ⸤appointed you as a commander⸥\f + \fr 2:14 \ft Literally “put you for a man, a commander” or “placed you for a man, a commander” \f* and a judge over us? \add Are\add* you intending to kill me like you killed the Egyptian?” And Moses was afraid, and he said, “Surely the matter has become known.” 
\v 15 And Pharaoh heard this matter, and he sought to kill Moses, and Moses fled from Pharaoh, and he lived in the land of Midian, and he lived at ⸤a certain well⸥.\f + \fr 2:15 \ft Literally “the well” \f*
\p 
\v 16 \add Now\add* the priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came and drew water and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock.\f + \fr 2:16 \ft The Hebrew noun translated “flock” is used here and in verses 17 and 19 collectively for sheep or goats or a mix of the two \f* 
\v 17 And the shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses stood up and came to their rescue and watered their flock. 
\v 18 And they came to Reuel, their father, and he said, “⸤Why have you come so quickly⸥\f + \fr 2:18 \ft Literally “why did you hasten coming” \f* today?” 
\v 19 And they said, “An Egyptian man delivered us from the hand of the shepherds, and he even drew \add water\add* for us and watered the flock.” 
\v 20 And he said to his daughters, “Where \add is\add* he? ⸤Why then⸥\f + \fr 2:20 \ft Literally “why this” \f* have you left the man? ⸤Call him so that he can eat some food⸥.”\f + \fr 2:20 \ft Literally “call to \fq or “summon/invite” \ft him and he will eat bread” \f* 
\v 21 And Moses agreed to stay with the man, and he gave Zipporah his daughter to Moses. 
\v 22 And she bore a son, and he called his name Gershom because he said, “I am an alien in a foreign land.”\f + \fr 2:22 \ft The word translated “alien” sounds like the first syllable in the name Gershom. The second syllable sounds like the word for “there” \f*
\p 
\v 23 ⸤And then⸥\f + \fr 2:23 \ft Literally “and he/it was” \f* during those many days, the king of Egypt died, and the ⸤Israelites⸥\f + \fr 2:23 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* groaned because of the work, and they cried out, and their cry for help because of the work went up to God. 
\v 24 And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob, 
\v 25 and God saw the ⸤Israelites⸥,\f + \fr 2:25 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* and God took notice.\f + \fr 2:25 \ft Or “and God knew” \f*

\s1 Yahweh’s Plan to Rescue the Israelites
\m 
\v 1 And Moses was a shepherd with the flock\f + \fr 3:1 \ft The Hebrew noun translated “flock” in this verse is used collectively for sheep or goats or a mix of the two. \f* of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the west \add of\add* the desert, and he came to the mountain of God, to Horeb. 
\v 2 And the angel of Yahweh appeared to him in a flame of fire from the midst of a bush, and he looked, and there was the bush burning with fire, but the bush was not being consumed. 
\v 3 And Moses said, “Let me turn aside and see this great sight. Why does the bush not burn up?” 
\v 4 And Yahweh saw that he turned aside to see, and God called to him from the midst of the bush, and he said, “Moses, Moses.” And he said, “Here I \add am\add*.” 
\v 5 And he said, “You must not come near to here. Take off your sandals from on your feet, because the place on which you \add are\add* standing, it \add is\add* holy ground.” 
\v 6 And he said, “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” And Moses hid his face because he was afraid of looking at God.
\p 
\v 7 And Yahweh said, “Surely I have seen the misery of my people who \add are\add* in Egypt, and I have heard their cry of distress because of their oppressors, for I know their sufferings. 
\v 8 And I have come down to deliver them from the hand of \add the\add* Egyptians and to bring them up from this land to a good and wide land, to a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanites\f + \fr 3:8 \ft Hebrew “Canaanite” \f* and the Hittites\f + \fr 3:8 \ft Hebrew “Hittite” \f* and the Amorites\f + \fr 3:8 \ft Hebrew “Amorite” \f* and the Perizzites\f + \fr 3:8 \ft Hebrew “Perizzite” \f* and the Hivites\f + \fr 3:8 \ft Hebrew “Hivite” \f* and the Jebusites.\f + \fr 3:8 \ft Hebrew “Jebusite” \f* 
\v 9 And now, look, the cry of distress of the ⸤Israelites⸥\f + \fr 3:9 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* has come to me, and also I see the oppression \add with\add* which \add the\add* Egyptians \add are\add* oppressing them. 
\v 10 And now come, and I will send you to Pharaoh, and \add you must\add* bring my people, the ⸤Israelites⸥,\f + \fr 3:10 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* out from Egypt.”
\p 
\v 11 But Moses said to God, “Who \add am\add* I that I should go to Pharaoh and that I should bring the ⸤Israelites⸥\f + \fr 3:11 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* out from Egypt?” 
\v 12 And he said, “Because I am with you, and this \add will be\add* the sign for you that I myself have sent you: When you bring the people out from Egypt, you will serve God on this mountain.” 
\v 13 But Moses said to God, “Look, \add if\add* I go to the ⸤Israelites⸥\f + \fr 3:13 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* and I say to them, ‘The God of your ancestors\f + \fr 3:13 \ft Or “fathers” \f* has sent me to you,’ and they say to me, ‘What \add is\add* his name?’ \add then\add* what shall I say to them?” 
\v 14 And God said to Moses, “I am that I am.” And he said, “So you must say to the ⸤Israelites⸥,\f + \fr 3:14 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* ‘I am sent me to you.’ ”
\p 
\v 15 And God said again to Moses, “So you must say to the ⸤Israelites⸥,\f + \fr 3:15 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* ‘Yahweh, the God of your ancestors,\f + \fr 3:15 \ft Or “fathers” \f* the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you. This \add is\add* my name forever, and this \add is\add* my remembrance from generation \add to\add* generation.’ 
\v 16 Go and gather the elders of Israel and say to them, ‘Yahweh, the God of your ancestors,\f + \fr 3:16 \ft Or “fathers” \f* appeared to me, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, “I have carefully attended to you and what has been done to you in Egypt.” 
\v 17 And I said, “I will bring you up from the misery of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites\f + \fr 3:17 \ft Hebrew “Canaanite” \f* and the Hittites\f + \fr 3:17 \ft Hebrew “Hittite” \f* and the Amorites\f + \fr 3:17 \ft Hebrew “Amorite” \f* and the Perizzites\f + \fr 3:17 \ft Hebrew “Perizzite” \f* and the Hivites\f + \fr 3:17 \ft Hebrew “Hivite” \f* and the Jebusites,\f + \fr 3:17 \ft Hebrew “Jebusite” \f* to a land flowing with milk and honey.” ’ 
\v 18 And they will listen to your voice, and you will go, you and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and you will say to him, ‘Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews has met with us, and now let us please go \add on\add* a journey of three days into the desert, and let us sacrifice to Yahweh our God.’
\p 
\v 19 But I myself know that the king of Egypt will not allow you to go ⸤unless compelled by a strong hand⸥.\f + \fr 3:19 \ft Literally “and not with a strong hand” \f* 
\v 20 And I will stretch out my hand, and I will strike Egypt with all of my wonders that I will do in its midst, and ⸤afterward⸥\f + \fr 3:20 \ft Literally “after so” or “after \fq I do \ft so” \f* he will release you. 
\v 21 And I will give this people favor in the eyes of \add the\add* Egyptians, ⸤and then⸥\f + \fr 3:21 \ft Literally “and he/it will be” \f* when you go, you will not go empty-handed. 
\v 22 And a woman will ask from her neighbor and from the woman dwelling as an alien in her house \add for\add* objects of silver and objects of gold and garments, and you will put \add them\add* on your sons and on your daughters; and you will plunder Egypt.”

\s1 Yahweh Provides Signs and Help for Speaking
\m 
\v 1 And Moses answered, and he said, “And if they do not believe me and they do not listen to my voice, but they say, ‘Yahweh did not appear to you?’ ” 
\v 2 And Yahweh said to him, “What \add is\add* this in your hand?” And he said, “A staff.” 
\v 3 And he said, “Throw it onto the ground.” And he threw it onto the ground, and it became a snake, and Moses fled from it. 
\v 4 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Reach out your hand and grasp \add it\add* by its tail”—” (And he reached out his hand and grabbed it, and it became a staff in his palm.)—
\v 5 “so that they may believe that Yahweh, the God of their ancestors,\f + \fr 4:5 \ft Or “fathers” \f* appeared to you, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.”
\p 
\v 6 And Yahweh said to him again, “Put your hand into the fold of your garment.” And he put his hand into the fold of his garment, and he took it out, and, ⸤to his surprise⸥,\f + \fr 4:6 \ft Literally “look” or “behold” \f* his hand \add was\add* afflicted with a skin disease, like snow. 
\v 7 And he said, “Return your hand to the fold of your garment.” And he returned his hand to the fold of his garment, and he took it out from the fold of his garment, and, ⸤to his surprise⸥,\f + \fr 4:7 \ft Literally “look” or “behold” \f* it was restored like the rest of his body. 
\v 8 “⸤And⸥\f + \fr 4:8 \ft Literally “and he/it will be” \f* if they do not believe you and they will not listen to the voice of the former sign, \add then\add* they will believe the voice of the latter sign. 
\v 9 ⸤And⸥\f + \fr 4:9 \ft Literally “and he/it will be” \f* if they also do not believe the second of these signs and they will not listen to your voice, \add then\add* you must take water from the Nile and pour \add it\add* onto the dry ground, and the water that you take from the Nile will become blood on the dry ground.”
\p 
\v 10 And Moses said to Yahweh, “Please, Lord, I \add am\add* not a man of words, ⸤neither recently nor in the past nor since your speaking⸥\f + \fr 4:10 \ft Literally “also from yesterday also from the day before also from then your speaking” \f* to your servant, because I \add am\add* heavy of mouth and of tongue.” 
\v 11 And Yahweh said to him, “Who gave a mouth to humankind, or who makes mute or deaf or sighted or blind? \add Is it\add* not I, Yahweh? 
\v 12 So then go, and I myself will be with your mouth, and I will teach you what you must speak.” 
\v 13 And he said, “Please, Lord, do send ⸤anyone else whom you wish to send⸥.”\f + \fr 4:13 \ft Literally “by the hand of \fq someone \ft you will send” \f* 
\v 14 ⸤And Yahweh was angry with⸥\f + \fr 4:14 \ft Literally “and the nose of Yahweh was hot against” \f* Moses and said, “\add Is there\add* not Aaron your brother the Levite? I know that he certainly can speak, and also there he is coming out to meet you, and when he sees you, he will rejoice in his heart. 
\v 15 And you will speak to him, and you will put words in his mouth, and I myself will be with your mouth and with his mouth, and I will teach you what you must do. 
\v 16 And he will speak for you to the people, ⸤and then⸥\f + \fr 4:16 \ft Literally “and he/it will be” \f* he will be to you as a mouth, and you will be to him as a god. 
\v 17 And you must take this staff in your hand, with which you will do the signs.”
\s1 Moses Leaves Midian and Returns to Egypt
\m 
\v 18 And Moses went, and he returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and he said to him, “Please let me go, and let me return to my brothers who \add are\add* in Egypt, and let me see whether they \add are\add* yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, “Go in peace.” 
\v 19 And Yahweh said to Moses in Midian, “Go, return to Egypt because all the men have died who \add were\add* seeking your life.”
\p 
\v 20 And Moses took his wife and his sons and had them ride on the donkey, and he returned to the land of Egypt, and Moses took the staff of God in his hand. 
\v 21 And Yahweh said to Moses, “When you go to return to Egypt, see all of the wonders that I have put in your hand, and do them before Pharaoh, and I myself will harden his heart, and he will not release the people. 
\v 22 And you must say to Pharaoh, ‘Thus says Yahweh, “Israel \add is\add* my son, my firstborn.” 
\v 23 And I said to you, “Release my son and let him serve me,” but you refused to release him. Look, I \add am about\add* to kill your son, your firstborn.’ ”
\p 
\v 24 ⸤And⸥\f + \fr 4:24 \ft Literally “and he/it was” \f* on the way, at the place of overnight lodging, Yahweh encountered him and sought to kill him. 
\v 25 But Zipporah took a flint \add knife\add*, and she cut off the foreskin of her son, and she touched his feet, and she said, “Yes, you \add are\add* a bridegroom of blood to me.” 
\v 26 And he left him alone. At that time she said, “A bridegroom of blood,” because of the circumcision.\f + \fr 4:26 \ft Hebrew “circumcisions” \f*
\p 
\v 27 And Yahweh said to Aaron, “Go to the desert to meet Moses.” And he went and encountered him at the mountain of God and kissed him. 
\v 28 And Moses told Aaron all the words of Yahweh, who had sent him—and all the signs that he had commanded him.
\p 
\v 29 And Moses and Aaron went, and they gathered all of the elders of the ⸤Israelites⸥.\f + \fr 4:29 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* 
\v 30 And Aaron spoke all the words that Yahweh had spoken to Moses, and he did the signs before the eyes of the people. 
\v 31 And the people believed when they heard that Yahweh had attended to the ⸤Israelites⸥\f + \fr 4:31 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* and that he had seen their misery, and they knelt down and they worshiped.
\c 5
\s1 Pharaoh Rejects Yahweh’s Authority and Makes Israel’s Troubles Worse
\m 
\v 1 And afterward, Moses and Aaron went, and they said to Pharaoh, “Thus says Yahweh the God of Israel, ‘Release my people so that they may hold a festival for me in the desert.’ ” 
\v 2 And Pharaoh said, “Who is Yahweh that I should listen to his voice to release Israel? I do not know Yahweh, and also I will not release Israel.”
\p 
\v 3 And they said, “The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us go \add on\add* a three-day journey into the desert, and let us sacrifice to Yahweh our God, lest he strike us with plague or with sword.” 
\v 4 And the king of Egypt said, “Why, Moses and Aaron, do you take\f + \fr 5:4 \ft Or “let loose,” “let run wild” (compare 32:25) \f* the people from their work? Go to your ⸤forced labor⸥!”\f + \fr 5:4 \ft Literally “burdens” or “burdensome labor” \f* 
\v 5 And Pharaoh said, “Look, the people of the land \add are\add* now many, and you want to stop them from their ⸤forced labor⸥.”\f + \fr 5:5 \ft Literally “burdens” or “burdensome labor” \f*
\p 
\v 6 And on that day Pharaoh commanded the slave drivers over the people and his foremen, saying, 
\v 7 “You must no longer give straw to the people to make the bricks like ⸤before⸥.\f + \fr 5:7 \ft Literally “yesterday three days ago” \f* Let them go and gather straw for themselves. 
\v 8 But the quota of the bricks that they \add were\add* making ⸤before⸥\f + \fr 5:8 \ft Literally “yesterday three days ago” \f* ⸤you must require of them⸥.\f + \fr 5:8 \ft Literally “you will put on them” \f* You must not reduce from it, because they \add are\add* lazy. Therefore they \add are\add* crying out, saying, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to our God.’ 
\v 9 Let the work be heavier on the men so that they will do it and not pay attention to words of deception.”
\p 
\v 10 And the slave drivers of the people and their foremen went out, and they spoke to the people, saying, “Thus says Pharaoh, ‘I \add am\add* not giving you straw. 
\v 11 You go, get straw for yourselves from whatever you find because not a thing is being reduced from your work.’ ” 
\v 12 And the people spread out in all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for the straw. 
\v 13 And the slave drivers \add were\add* insisting, saying, “Finish your work ⸤for each day⸥\f + \fr 5:13 \ft Literally “a thing of a day” \f* on its day, as ⸤when there was straw⸥.”\f + \fr 5:13 \ft Literally “in the being of the straw” \f* 
\v 14 And the foremen of the ⸤Israelites⸥,\f + \fr 5:14 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* whom Pharaoh’s slave drivers had appointed over them, were beaten \add by men who were\add* saying, “Why have you not completed your portion of brickmaking ⸤as before, both yesterday and today⸥?”\f + \fr 5:14 \ft Literally “as yesterday three days ago also yesterday also the day” \f*
\s1 The Foremen Complain to Pharaoh and Moses, and Moses Complains to Yahweh
\m 
\v 15 And the foremen of the ⸤Israelites⸥\f + \fr 5:15 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* came and cried out to Pharaoh, saying, “Why do you treat your servants like this? 
\v 16 Straw \add is\add* not being given to your servants, but \add they are\add* saying to us, ‘Make bricks!’ and, look, your servants \add are\add* being beaten, but it is the fault of\f + \fr 5:16 \ft The expression is difficult. The word translated “fault” or “sin” has pointing for a second-person feminine singular subject (“you sinned”), which does not go well with either “Pharaoh” or “your people” as a subject; but the noun translated “sin of” has the same consonants, leading to the possibility that the word should be understood as a noun \f* your people.” 
\v 17 And he said, “You \add are\add* lazy, lazy! Therefore you \add are\add* saying, ‘Let us go; let us sacrifice to Yahweh.’ 
\v 18 And now go, work, but straw will not be given to you, and you must give the full quota of bricks.”
\p 
\v 19 And the foremen of the ⸤Israelites⸥\f + \fr 5:19 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* saw they were in trouble ⸤with the saying⸥,\f + \fr 5:19 \ft Literally “saying” \f* “You will not reduce from your bricks ⸤for each day⸥\f + \fr 5:19 \ft Literally “a thing of a day” \f* on its day.” 
\v 20 And they met Moses and Aaron, \add who were\add* waiting to meet them when they \add were\add* going out from Pharaoh. 
\v 21 And they said to them, “May Yahweh look upon you and judge because you have caused our fragrance to stink in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants \add so as\add* to put a sword into their hand to kill us.” 
\v 22 And Moses returned to Yahweh and said, “Lord, why have you brought trouble to this people? Why ever did you send me? 
\v 23 And from the time I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble to this people, and you have certainly not delivered your people.”

\s1 Yahweh Discusses His Name and Israel’s Future
\m 
\v 1 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh, because with a strong hand he will release them, and with a strong hand he will drive them out from his land.”
\p 
\v 2 And God spoke to Moses, and he said to him, “I \add am\add* Yahweh.

\v 8 And Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron and said, “Pray to Yahweh, and let him remove the frogs from me and from my people, and let me release the people so that they can sacrifice to Yahweh.”

\v 17 And he did so, and Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff, and he struck the dust of the land, and it became gnats on the humans and on the animals; all of the dust of the land became gnats in all the land of Egypt. 
\v 18 And the magicians did so with their secret arts to bring out the gnats, but they were not able, and the gnats were on the humans and on the animals. 
\v 19 And the magicians said to Pharaoh, “It is the finger of God.” But the heart of Pharaoh was hard, and he did not listen to them, as Yahweh had spoken.
\s1 Plague Four: Flies

\v 20 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Start early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh. Look, \add he is\add* going out to the water, and you must say to him, ‘Thus says Yahweh, “Release my people so that they may serve me.”

\p 
\v 16 And Pharaoh hurried to call Moses and Aaron, and he said, “I have sinned against Yahweh your God and against you. 
\v 17 And now forgive my sin surely this time, and pray to Yahweh your God so that he may only remove from me this death.” 
\v 18 And he went out from Pharaoh, and he prayed to Yahweh.

\s1 Plague Nine: Darkness
\m 
\v 21 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward the heavens so that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt and so that \add a person can\add* feel darkness.” 
\v 22 And Moses stretched out his hand toward the heavens, and there was darkness of night in all the land of Egypt \add for\add* three days. 
\v 23 No one could see his brother, and ⸤because of it no one could move from where they were⸥\f + \fr 10:23 \ft Literally “a man did not rise from under it” \f* \add for\add* three days, but there was light for the ⸤Israelites⸥\f + \fr 10:23 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* in their dwellings.

\v 25 And Moses said, “Even \add if\add* you yourself put into our hand sacrifices and burnt offerings and we offer \add them\add* to Yahweh our God, 
\v 26 our livestock must also go with us. Not a hoof can be left because we must take from them to serve Yahweh our God. And we will not know \add with\add* what we are to serve Yahweh until we come there.” 
\v 27 And Yahweh hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he was not willing to release them.

\s1 Announcement of the Tenth Plague: Death of the Firstborn
\m 
\v 1 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Still one plague I will bring upon Pharaoh and upon Egypt; afterward he will release you from here. At the moment of his releasing, he will certainly drive you completely out from here. 
\v 2 Speak in the ears of the people, and let them ask, a man from his neighbor and a woman from her neighbor, \add for\add* objects of silver and objects of gold.” 
\v 3 And Yahweh gave the people favor in the eyes of Egypt. Also the man Moses \add was\add* very great in the land of Egypt, in the eyes of the servants of Pharaoh and in the eyes of the people.
\p 
\v 4 And Moses said, “Thus says Yahweh, ‘About the middle of the night I \add will\add* go out through the midst of Egypt, 
\v 5 and every firstborn in the land of Egypt will die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne to the firstborn of the slave woman who \add is\add* behind the pair of millstones and every firstborn animal.\f + \fr 11:5 \ft The Hebrew word often refers to domestic animals \f*

\v 3 Speak to all the community of Israel, saying, ‘On the tenth of this month, they will each take for themselves ⸤a lamb for the family⸥,\f + \fr 12:3 \ft Literally “a lamb/kid for the house of fathers.” The word translated “lamb” refers to a small livestock animal and could be either a young sheep or a young goat \f* a lamb for the household.

\v 6 “⸤You will keep it⸥\f + \fr 12:6 \ft Literally “It will be for you for observation” \f* until the fourteenth day of this month, and all the assembly of the community of Israel will slaughter it ⸤at twilight⸥.\f + \fr 12:6 \ft Literally “between the evenings” \f* 
\v 7 And they will take \add some\add* of the blood and put \add it\add* on the two doorposts and on the lintel on the houses in which they eat it.

\v 9 You must not eat any of it raw or boiled, boiled in the water, but rather roasted with fire, its head with its legs and with its inner parts.

\v 11 And this is how you will eat it—\add with\add* your waists fastened, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand, and you will eat it in haste. It \add is\add* Yahweh’s Passover.
\p 
\v 12 “And I will go through the land of Egypt during this night, and I will strike all of the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from human to animal, and I will do punishments among all of the gods of Egypt. I \add am\add* Yahweh. 
\v 13 And the blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are, and I will see the blood, and I will pass over you, and there will not be a destructive plague among you when I strike the land of Egypt.
\p 
\v 14 “And this day will become a memorial for you, and you will celebrate it as a religious feast for Yahweh throughout your generations; you will celebrate it as a lasting statute. 
\v 15 You will eat unleavened bread for seven days. Surely on the first day you shall remove yeast from your houses, because anyone \add who\add* eats \add food with\add* yeast from the first day until the seventh day—that person will be cut off from Israel.

\v 17 “And you will keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread, because on this very day I brought out your divisions from the land of Egypt, and you will keep this day for your generations as a lasting statute. 
\v 18 On the first \add day\add*, on the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening, you will eat unleavened bread until the evening of the twenty-first day of the month.

\v 32 Take both your sheep and goats as well as your cattle, and go, and bless also me.”
\p 
\v 33 And \add the\add* Egyptians urged the people \add in order\add* to hurry their release\f + \fr 12:33 \ft Or “to hasten to release them” \f* from the land, because they said, “All of us \add will\add* die!”\f + \fr 12:33 \ft Or “We all are dead!” \f* 
\v 34 And the people lifted up their dough before it had yeast; their kneading troughs \add were\add* wrapped up in their cloaks on their shoulder. 
\v 35 And the ⸤Israelites⸥\f + \fr 12:35 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* did according to the word of Moses, and they asked from \add the\add* Egyptians \add for\add* objects of silver and objects of gold and \add for\add* clothing.

\v 37 And the ⸤Israelites⸥\f + \fr 12:37 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* set out from Rameses to Succoth; the men \add were\add* about six hundred thousand on foot,\f + \fr 12:37 \ft Or “footmen,” “infantrymen.” The word probably has military connotations, as when it is used elsewhere in the numbering of soldiers (compare \xt 2 Sam 10:6 \ft ; \xt 1 Kgs 20:29 \ft ; \xt 2 Kgs 13:7 \ft ) \f* besides dependents. 
\v 38 And also a ⸤mixed multitude⸥\f + \fr 12:38 \ft Literally “a large mixture” (compare \xt Jer 25:20 \ft ; \xt Ezek 30:5 \ft ) \f* went up with them and sheep and goats and cattle, very numerous livestock. 
\v 39 And they baked the dough that they had brought out from Egypt \add as\add* cakes, unleavened bread, because it had no yeast when they were driven out from Egypt, and they were not able to delay, and also they had not made provisions for themselves.
\p 
\v 40 And the period of dwelling of the ⸤Israelites⸥\f + \fr 12:40 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* that they dwelled in Egypt \add was\add* four hundred and thirty years.

\v 45 A temporary resident and a hired worker may not eat it. 
\v 46 It will be eaten in one house; you will not bring part of the meat out from the house to the outside; and you will not break a bone of it. 
\v 47 All of the community of Israel will prepare it. 
\v 48 And when an alien dwells with you and he wants to prepare \add the\add* Passover for Yahweh, every male belonging to him must be circumcised, and then he may come near to prepare it, and he will be as the native of the land, but any uncircumcised \add man\add* may not eat it.

\v 12 Isn’t this the word we spoke to you in Egypt, saying, ‘Leave us alone \add so that\add* we can serve Egypt!’ because serving Egypt is better for us than our dying in the desert.”

\s1 Yahweh Provides Food in the Desert

\v 1 And they set out from Elim, and all the community of the ⸤Israelites⸥\f + \fr 16:1 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* came to the desert of Sin, which \add is\add* between Elim ⸤and Sinai⸥,\f + \fr 16:1 \ft Literally “and between Sinai” \f* in the fifteenth day of the second month of their going out from the land of Egypt. 
\v 2 And all the community of the ⸤Israelites⸥\f + \fr 16:2 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* grumbled against Moses and against Aaron in the desert. 
\v 3 And the ⸤Israelites⸥\f + \fr 16:3 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* said to them, “⸤If only we had died⸥\f + \fr 16:3 \ft Literally “who will give our dying” \f* by the hand of Yahweh in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the pots\f + \fr 16:3 \ft Hebrew “pot” \f* of meat, when we ate bread ⸤until we were full⸥,\f + \fr 16:3 \ft Literally “to contentment” or “to satisfaction” \f* because you have brought us out to this desert to kill all of this assembly with hunger.”

\v 5 And then on the sixth day, they will prepare what they bring, and it will be twice over what they will gather every \add other\add* day.”
\p 
\v 6 And Moses and Aaron said to all the ⸤Israelites⸥,\f + \fr 16:6 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* “\add In the\add* evening, you will know that Yahweh has brought you out from the land of Egypt,

\v 9 And Moses said to Aaron, “Say to all the community of the ⸤Israelites⸥,\f + \fr 16:9 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* ‘Come near before Yahweh because he has heard your grumblings.’ ”
\p 
\v 10 And at the moment of Aaron’s speaking to all the community of the ⸤Israelites⸥,\f + \fr 16:10 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* they turned to the desert, ⸤and just then⸥\f + \fr 16:10 \ft Literally “look” or “behold” \f* the glory of Yahweh appeared in the cloud. 
\v 11 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

\p 
\v 13 And so it was, in the evening, the quail came up and covered the camp, and in the morning, a layer of dew was all around the camp. 
\v 14 And the layer of dew came up, ⸤and there⸥\f + \fr 16:14 \ft Literally “look” or “behold” \f* on the face of the desert was a fine granular substance, fine like frost on the ground. 
\v 15 And the ⸤Israelites⸥\f + \fr 16:15 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* saw, and they said ⸤to each other⸥,\f + \fr 16:15 \ft Literally “a man to his brother” \f* “What \add is\add* this?” because they did not know what it \add was\add*. And Moses said to them, “That \add is\add* the bread that Yahweh has given to you as food.

\p 
\v 17 And the ⸤Israelites⸥\f + \fr 16:17 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* did so, and they gathered, some more and some less. 
\v 18 And \add when\add* they measured with the omer, the one gathering more had no surplus, and the one gathering less had no lack; they gathered ⸤each according to what he could eat⸥.\f + \fr 16:18 \ft Literally “a man for the mouth of his eating” \f* 
\v 19 And Moses said to them, “Let no one leave any of it until morning.” 
\v 20 But they did not listen to Moses. Some people\f + \fr 16:20 \ft Literally “men” \f* left \add some\add* of it until morning, and it bred worms and stank. And Moses was angry with them.

\p 
\v 22 And when it was the sixth day, they gathered twice \add as much\add* bread, two omers for one \add person\add*, and all the leaders of the community came and told Moses.

\v 24 And they put it aside until the morning, as Moses had commanded, and it did not make a stench, and not a maggot was in it. 
\v 25 And Moses said, “Eat it today, because today is a Sabbath for Yahweh. Today you will not find it in the field. 
\v 26 Six days you will gather it, but on the seventh day, \add the\add* Sabbath, it will not be \add present\add* on it.”
\p 
\v 27 And on the seventh day \add some\add* of the people went out to gather, and they did not find \add any\add*. 
\v 28 And Yahweh said to Moses, “How long do you\f + \fr 16:28 \ft Plural \f* refuse to keep my commands and my laws?

\v 32 And Moses said, “This is the word that Yahweh has commanded. ‘A full omer of it \add is\add* for safekeeping for your generations so that they will see the bread that I fed you in the desert when I brought you from the land of Egypt.’ ” 
\v 33 And Moses said to Aaron, “Take one jar and put there a full omer of manna. Leave it before Yahweh for safekeeping for your generations.” 
\v 34 As Yahweh had commanded Moses, so Aaron left it before the testimony for safekeeping. 
\v 35 And the ⸤Israelites⸥\f + \fr 16:35 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* ate the manna forty years, until their coming to an inhabited land; they ate the manna until their coming to the border of the land of Canaan.

\v 27 And he said to them, “Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, ‘Put each his sword on his side. Go ⸤back and forth⸥\f + \fr 32:27 \ft Literally “through and come back” \f* from gate to gate in the camp, and kill, each his brother and each his friend and each his close relative.’ ”

\p 
\v 31 And Moses returned to Yahweh, and he said, “Alas, this people has sinned a great sin and made for themselves gods of gold. 
\v 32 And now if you will forgive their sin—and if not, please blot me from your scroll that you have written.” 
\v 33 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Whoever has sinned against me I will blot him from my scroll. 
\v 34 And now go, lead the people to where I spoke to you. Look, my angel will go before you, and on the day \add when\add* I punish I will punish them \add for\add* their sin.” 
\v 35 And Yahweh afflicted the people because they had made the bull calf that Aaron had made.

\s1 Command to Resume Travel
\m 
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, “Go, go up from here, you and the people whom you have brought up from the land of Egypt, to the land that I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, ‘I will give it to your offspring.’ 
\v 2 And I will send an angel before you, and I will drive out the Canaanites,\f + \fr 33:2 \ft Hebrew “Canaanite” \f* the Amorites,\f + \fr 33:2 \ft Hebrew “Amorite” \f* and the Hittites\f + \fr 33:2 \ft Hebrew “Hittite” \f* and the Perizzites,\f + \fr 33:2 \ft Hebrew “Perizzite” \f* the Hivites,\f + \fr 33:2 \ft Hebrew “Hivite” \f* and the Jebusites,\f + \fr 33:2 \ft Hebrew “Jebusite” \f* 
\v 3 \add Go\add* to a land flowing with milk and honey, but I will not go up among you, because you \add are\add* a stiff-necked people, lest I destroy you on the way.” 
\v 4 And the people heard this troubling\f + \fr 33:4 \ft Or “bad,” “disastrous,” “calamitous” \f* word, and they mourned, and they each did not put their ornaments on themselves.
\p 
\v 5 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Say to the ⸤Israelites⸥,\f + \fr 33:5 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* ‘You \add are\add* a stiff-necked people; \add if\add* one moment I were to go up among you, I would destroy you.

\v 6 And the ⸤Israelites⸥\f + \fr 33:6 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* stripped themselves of their ornaments from Mount Horeb \add onward\add*.
\s1 The Tent outside the Camp
\m 
\v 7 And Moses took the tent and pitched it outside the camp far from the camp, and he called it the tent of assembly, ⸤and⸥\f + \fr 33:7 \ft Literally “and it would be” \f* all seeking Yahweh would go out to the tent of assembly, which \add was\add* outside the camp.

\v 10 And all the people would see the column of cloud standing \add at\add* the opening of the tent, and all the people would rise and bow in worship, each \add at\add* the opening of his tent. 
\v 11 And Yahweh would speak to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his neighbor. And he would return to the camp, and his assistant Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, did not leave the middle of the tent.
\s1 Presence and Glory
\m 
\v 12 And Moses said to Yahweh, “See, you \add are\add* saying to me, ‘Take this people up.’ But you have not let me know whom you will send with me, and you yourself have said, ‘I know you by name, and you also have found favor in my eyes.’ 
\v 13 And now if I have found favor in your eyes, make known \add to\add* me, please, your way, and so I may know you so that I can find favor in your eyes. And see that this nation is your people.” 
\v 14 And he said, “My presence will go, and I will give you rest.” 
\v 15 And he said to him, “If your presence \add is\add* not going, do not bring us up from here. 
\v 16 And by what will it be known then that I have found favor in your eyes, I and your people? Is it not by your going with us? And \add so\add* we will be distinguished, I and your people, from all the people who \add are\add* on the face of the ground.”
\p 
\v 17 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Also I will do this thing that you have spoken, because you have found favor in my eyes and I have known you by name.”
\p 
\v 18 And he said, “Please show me your glory.”
\p 
\v 19 And he said, “I myself will cause all my goodness to pass over before you, and I will proclaim the name of Yahweh before you, and I will be gracious \add to\add* whom I will be gracious, and I will show compassion \add to\add* whom I will show compassion.” 
\v 20 But he said, “You are not able to see my face, because \add a\add* human will not see me and live.” 
\v 21 And Yahweh said, “There is a place with me, and you will stand on the rock. 
\v 22 ⸤And⸥\f + \fr 33:22 \ft Literally “and it will be” \f* when my glory passes over, I will put you in the rock’s crevice, and I will cover you \add with\add* my hand until I pass over. 
\v 23 And I will remove my hand, and you will see my back, but my face will not be visible.”
\c 34
\s1 Yahweh’s Description of Himself
\m 
\v 1 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Cut for yourself two stone tablets like the first ones, and I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke. 
\v 2 And be ready for the morning, and go up in the morning to Mount Sinai and present yourself to me there on the top of the mountain. 
\v 3 And no one will go up with you, and neither let anyone be seen on all the mountain, nor let the sheep and goats and the cattle graze ⸤opposite⸥\f + \fr 34:3 \ft Literally “to the front of” \f* that mountain.”
\p 
\v 4 And Moses cut two stone tablets like the first ones, and he started early in the morning, and he went up to Mount Sinai, as Yahweh had commanded him, and he took in his hand the two stone tablets. 
\v 5 And Yahweh descended in the cloud, and he stood with him there, and he proclaimed the name of Yahweh. 
\v 6 And Yahweh passed over before him, and he proclaimed, “Yahweh, Yahweh, God, \add who is\add* compassionate and gracious, ⸤slow to anger⸥,\f + \fr 34:6 \ft Literally “long of nose” \f* and abounding with\f + \fr 34:6 \ft Or “rich in” or “great of” \f* loyal love and faithfulness, 
\v 7 keeping loyal love to the thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and he does not leave utterly unpunished, punishing \add the\add* guilt of fathers on sons and on sons of sons on third and fourth \add generations\add*.”
\p 
\v 8 And Moses hurried and knelt down to the earth and worshiped. 
\v 9 And he said, “Please, if I have found favor in your eyes, Lord, let my Lord, please, go among us—indeed it is a stiff-necked people—and forgive our iniquity and our sin and ⸤take us as your possession⸥.”\f + \fr 34:9 \ft Or “take possession of us,” “make us your inheritance” \f*
\s1 Covenant Stipulations
\m 
\v 10 And he said, “Look, I \add am about to\add* make a covenant. In front of all your people I will do wonders that have not been created on all the earth and among all the nations, and all the people among whom you \add are\add* will see Yahweh’s work, because what I \add am about to\add* do with you \add will be\add* awesome.
\p 
\v 11 “Keep for yourself what I myself have commanded you today.

\v 12 Be careful for yourself, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land to which you are going, lest it be a snare among you. 
\v 13 Rather, you will tear down their altars, and you will break their stone pillars, and you will cut off their Asherah poles. 
\v 14 For you will not bow in worship to another god, for ‘Yahweh \add Is\add* Jealous’ is his name, he \add is\add* a jealous God, 
\v 15 lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they prostitute \add themselves\add* after their gods, and they sacrifice to their gods, and they invite you, and you eat their sacrifice, 
\v 16 and you take from their daughters for your sons, and their daughters prostitute \add themselves\add* after their gods, and they cause your sons to prostitute \add themselves\add* after their gods. 
\v 17 You will not make gods of cast metal for yourself.
\p 
\v 18 “You will keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread. Seven days you will eat unleavened bread, which I commanded you, at the appointed time of the month of Abib, for in the month of Abib you came out from Egypt. 
\v 19 Every first offspring of a womb \add is\add* for me—all of your male livestock, \add the\add* first offspring of cattle and small livestock. 
\v 20 But the first offspring of a donkey you will redeem with small livestock, and if you will not redeem \add it\add*, you will break its neck. Every firstborn of your sons you will redeem, and you will not appear before me empty-handed. 
\v 21 Six days you will work, and on the seventh day you will rest; in the \add time of\add* plowing and in the \add time of\add* harvest you will rest. 
\v 22 And ⸤you yourself⸥\f + \fr 34:22 \ft Literally “for yourself” or “as for you, you will observe” \f* will observe the Feast of Weeks—the firstfruits of the wheat harvest—and the Feast of Harvest Gathering at the turn of the year. 
\v 23 Three times in the year all your males will appear before the Lord, Yahweh, the God of Israel, 
\v 24 because I will evict nations before you, and I will enlarge your territory, and no one will covet your land when you go up to appear before Yahweh your God three times in the year.
\p 
\v 25 “You will not slaughter the blood of my sacrifice on \add food with\add* yeast, and the sacrifice of the Feast of the Passover will not stay overnight to the morning. 
\v 26 The beginning of the firstfruits of your land you will bring \add to\add* the house of Yahweh your God. You will not boil a young goat\f + \fr 34:26 \ft Or “kid” \f* in its mother’s milk.”
\p 
\v 27 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Write for yourself these words, because ⸤according to⸥\f + \fr 34:27 \ft Literally “on the mouth of” \f* these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.”
\s1 The Shining Face of Moses
\m 
\v 28 And he was there with Yahweh forty days and forty nights. He ate no food and drank no water. And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the ten words. 
\v 29 ⸤And⸥\f + \fr 34:29 \ft Literally “And it was” \f* when Moses came down from Mount Sinai, the two tablets of the testimony \add were\add* in the hand of Moses at his coming down from the mountain; and Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone because of his speaking with him. 
\v 30 And Aaron and all the ⸤Israelites⸥\f + \fr 34:30 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* saw Moses, and, ⸤to their amazement⸥,\f + \fr 34:30 \ft Literally “look” or “behold” \f* the skin of his face shone, and they were afraid of coming near to him. 
\v 31 And Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the leaders of the community returned to him, and Moses spoke to them. 
\v 32 And afterward all the ⸤Israelites⸥\f + \fr 34:32 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* came near, and he commanded them all that Yahweh had spoken with him on Mount Sinai. 
\v 33 And Moses finished speaking with them, and he put a veil on his face. 
\v 34 And when Moses came before Yahweh to speak with him, he would remove the veil until he went out, and he would go out and would speak to the ⸤Israelites⸥\f + \fr 34:34 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* what he had been commanded. 
\v 35 And the ⸤Israelites⸥\f + \fr 34:35 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* would see the face of Moses, that the skin of the face of Moses shone, and Moses would put back the veil on his face until his coming to speak with him.

\s1 Preparation of Materials and People for Building
\m 
\v 1 And Moses assembled all the community of the ⸤Israelites⸥,\f + \fr 35:1 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* and he said to them, “These are the words that Yahweh has commanded \add for us\add* to do them.

\v 3 You will not kindle a fire in any of your dwellings on the day of the Sabbath.”
\p 
\v 4 And Moses said to all the community of the ⸤Israelites⸥,\f + \fr 35:4 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* saying, “This is the word that Yahweh has commanded, saying,

\p 
\v 20 And all the community of the ⸤Israelites⸥\f + \fr 35:20 \ft Literally “sons/children of Israel” \f* went out from before Moses. 
\v 21 And they came—every man whose heart lifted him and every man whose spirit impelled him—they brought Yahweh’s contribution for the work of the tent of assembly and for all its service and for the holy garments.
