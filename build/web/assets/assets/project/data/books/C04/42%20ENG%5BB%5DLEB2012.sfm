\q2 in the spirit and power of Elijah,
\q1 to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,
\q1 and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous,
\q2 to prepare for the Lord a people made ready.”
\sd0
\p 
\v 18 And Zechariah said to the angel, “By what will I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced ⸤in years⸥!”\f + \fr 1:18 \ft Literally “in her days” \f*

\p 
\v 24 Now after these days, his wife Elizabeth conceived, and she kept herself in seclusion \add for\add* five months, saying, 
\v 25 “Thus the Lord has done for me in the days in which he has concerned himself with \add me\add*,\ef + \fr 1:25 \ft *Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation \ef* to take away my disgrace among people.”
\s1 The Prediction of Jesus’ Birth
\m 
\v 26 Now in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town of Galilee ⸤named⸥\f + \fr 1:26 \ft Literally “to which the name” \f* Nazareth, 
\v 27 to a virgin legally promised in marriage to a man ⸤named⸥\f + \fr 1:27 \ft Literally “to whom the name” \f* Joseph of the house of David. And the name of the virgin \add was\add* Mary.

\v 30 And the angel said to her,
\sd0
\q1 “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.
\q1 
\v 31 And behold, you will conceive in the womb and will give birth to a son,
\q2 and you will call his name Jesus.
\q1 
\v 32 This one will be great, and he will be called the Son of the Most High,
\q2 and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David.
\q1 
\v 33 And he will reign over the house of Jacob ⸤forever⸥,\f + \fr 1:33 \ft Literally “for the ages” \f*
\q2 and of his kingdom there will be no end.
\sd0
\p 
\v 34 And Mary said to the angel, “How will this be, since I have not had sexual relations with a man?” 
\v 35 And the angel answered \add and\add*\ef + \fr 1:35 \ft ﻿*Here “\add and\add*” is supplied because the previous participle (“answered”) has been translated as a finite verb \ef* said to her,
\sd0
\q1 “The Holy Spirit will come upon you,
\q2 and the power of the Most High will overshadow you.
\q1 Therefore also the one to be born will be called holy, the Son of God.
\sd0
\p 
\v 36 And behold, your relative Elizabeth—she also has conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month for her who was called barren. 
\v 37 For ⸤nothing will be impossible with God⸥.”\f + \fr 1:37 \ft Literally “every thing will not be impossible with God” \f*
\p 
\v 38 So Mary said, “Behold, the Lord’s female slave! May it happen to me according to your word.” And the angel departed from her.

\v 42 And she cried out with a loud shout and said,
\sd0
\q1 “Blessed \add are\add* you among women,
\q2 and blessed \add is\add* the fruit of your womb!
\sd0
\p 
\v 43 And why \add is\add* this \add granted\add* to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? 
\v 44 For behold, when the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy! 
\v 45 And blessed \add is\add* she who believed that \add there\add* will be a fulfillment to what was spoken to her from the Lord!”
\s1 Mary’s Hymn of Praise to God
\m 
\v 46 And Mary said,
\sd0
\q1 “My soul exalts the Lord,
\q2 
\v 47 and my spirit has rejoiced greatly in God my Savior,
\q1 
\v 48 because he has looked upon the humble state of his female slave,
\q2 for behold, from now on all generations will consider me blessed,
\q1 
\v 49 because the Mighty \add One\add* has done great \add things\add* for me,
\q2 and holy \add is\add* his name.
\q1 
\v 50 And his mercy \add is\add* for generation after generation
\q2 to those who fear him.
\q1 
\v 51 He has done a mighty deed with his arm;
\q2 he has dispersed the proud in the thoughts of their hearts.
\q1 
\v 52 He has brought down rulers from \add their\add* thrones,
\q2 and has exalted the lowly.
\q1 
\v 53 He has filled those who are hungry with good \add things\add*,
\q2 and those who are rich he has sent away empty-handed.
\q1 
\v 54 He has helped Israel his servant,
\q2 remembering \add his\add* mercy,
\q1 
\v 55 just as he spoke to our fathers,
\q2 to Abraham and to his descendants ⸤forever⸥.”\f + \fr 1:55 \ft Literally “for the age” \f*
\sd0
\p 
\v 56 And Mary stayed with her about three months, and returned to her home.
\s1 The Birth of John the Baptist
\m 
\v 57 Now the time came for Elizabeth that she should give birth, and she gave birth to a son. 
\v 58 And her neighbors and relatives heard that ⸤the Lord had shown his great mercy to her⸥,\f + \fr 1:58 \ft Literally “the Lord had made great his mercy with her” \f* and they rejoiced with her. 
\v 59 And it happened that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were wanting to name him ⸤after⸥\f + \fr 1:59 \ft Literally “in the name of” \f* his father Zechariah. 
\v 60 And his mother answered \add and\add*\ef + \fr 1:60 \ft ﻿*Here “\add and\add*” is supplied because the previous participle (“answered”) has been translated as a finite verb \ef* said, “No, but he will be named John.” 
\v 61 And they said to her, “There is no one of your relatives who is called by this name.” 
\v 62 So they made signs to his father \add asking\add* what he wanted him to be named, 
\v 63 and he asked for a writing tablet \add and\add*\ef + \fr 1:63 \ft ﻿*Here “\add and\add*” is supplied because the previous participle (“asked for”) has been translated as a finite verb \ef* wrote, saying, “John is his name.” And they were all astonished. 
\v 64 And his mouth and his tongue were opened immediately, and he began to speak,\ef + \fr 1:64 \ft *The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here (“began to speak”) \ef* praising God. 
\v 65 And fear came on all those who lived near them, and in all the hill country of Judea all these events were discussed. 
\v 66 And all those who heard kept \add these things\add*\ef + \fr 1:66 \ft ﻿*Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation \ef* in their hearts, saying, “What then will this child be? For indeed the hand of the Lord was with him!”
\s1 The Praise and Prophecy of Zechariah
\m 
\v 67 And his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying,

\q1 
\v 68 “Blessed \add be\add* the Lord, the God of Israel,
\q2 because he has visited to help and ⸤has redeemed⸥\f + \fr 1:68 \ft Literally “has done redemption for” \f* his people,
\q1 
\v 69 and has raised up a horn of salvation for us
\q2 in the house of his servant David,
\q1 
\v 70 just as he spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets from earliest times—
\q2 
\v 71 salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all those who hate us,
\q1 
\v 72 to show mercy to our fathers
\q2 and to remember his holy covenant,
\q1 
\v 73 the oath that he swore to Abraham our father,
\q2 to grant us 
\v 74 \add that\add* we, being rescued from the hand of \add our\add* enemies,
\q1 could serve him without fear 
\v 75 in holiness and righteousness
\q2 before him all our days.
\q1 
\v 76 And so you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High,
\q2 for you will go on before the Lord to prepare his ways,
\q1 
\v 77 to give knowledge of salvation to his people
\q2 by the forgiveness of their sins,
\q1 
\v 78 because of the merciful compassion\f + \fr 1:78 \ft Or “heart” \f* of our God
\q2 by which the dawn will visit to help us from on high,
\q1 
\v 79 to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death,
\q2 to direct our feet into the way of peace.”
\sd0
\p 
\v 80 And the child kept growing and becoming strong in spirit, and was in the wilderness until the day of his public appearance to Israel.

\v 3 And everyone went to be registered, each one to his own town.

\v 8 And there were shepherds in the same region, living out of doors and keeping watch, guarding over their flock by night.
