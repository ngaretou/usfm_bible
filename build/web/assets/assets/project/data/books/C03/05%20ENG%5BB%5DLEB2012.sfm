\s1 Historical Prologue
\m 
\v 6 “Yahweh our God spoke to us at Horeb, ⸤saying⸥,\f + \fr 1:6 \ft Literally “to say” \f* ‘You have stayed ⸤long enough⸥\f + \fr 1:6 \ft Literally “much \fq time \ft ” \f* at this mountain. 
\v 7 Turn \add now\add* and ⸤move on⸥,\f + \fr 1:7 \ft Literally “journey on with respect to yourselves” or “move yourselves out” \f* and go \add into\add* the hill of the Amorites\f + \fr 1:7 \ft Hebrew “Amorite” \f* and to all \add of\add* the neighboring regions\f + \fr 1:7 \ft Or “peoples” \f* in the Jordan ⸤Valley⸥\f + \fr 1:7 \ft Literally “Arabah,” arid stretches of land. \f* in the hill country and in the Negev and in the coastal area along the sea, \add into\add* the land of the Canaanites\f + \fr 1:7 \ft Hebrew “Canaanite” \f* and \add into\add* the Lebanon, as far as the great river Euphrates. 
\v 8 Look, I have set the land ⸤before you⸥;\f + \fr 1:8 \ft Literally “before your face” \f* go and take possession of the land that Yahweh swore to your ancestors,\f + \fr 1:8 \ft Or “fathers” \f* to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give \add it\add* to them and to their offspring after them.’
\p 
\v 9 “And I spoke to them at that time, ⸤saying⸥,\f + \fr 1:9 \ft Literally “to say” \f* ‘I am not able to bear you alone. 
\v 10 Yahweh your God has multiplied you, and look; you \add are\add* today as the stars of the heaven ⸤in number⸥.\f + \fr 1:10 \ft Literally “with respect to multitude/abundance” \f* 
\v 11 Yahweh, the God of your ancestors,\f + \fr 1:11 \ft Or “fathers” \f* may he add to you as you are \add now\add* a thousand times, and may he bless you just as he ⸤promised you⸥.\f + \fr 1:11 \ft Literally “spoke to you” \f* 
\v 12 How can I bear you ⸤by myself⸥,\f + \fr 1:12 \ft Literally “to me alone” \f* your burden and your load and your strife? 
\v 13 Choose for yourselves ⸤wise and discerning and knowledgeable men⸥\f + \fr 1:13 \ft Literally “men wise and discerning and knowledgeable” \f* for \add each of\add* your tribes, and I will appoint them as your leaders.’
\p 
\v 14 “And you answered me, and you said, ‘The thing you have said to do is good.’ 
\v 15 And so I took the leaders of your tribes, wise and knowledgeable men, and \add then\add* I appointed them as leaders over you \add as\add* commanders of \add groups of\add* thousands and commanders of \add groups of\add* hundreds and commanders of \add groups of\add* fifties and commanders of \add groups of\add* tens \add as\add* officials for your tribes. 
\v 16 And at that time I instructed your judges, saying, ‘⸤hear out your fellow men⸥,\f + \fr 1:16 \ft Literally “hear between your brothers,” with the idea of listening carefully in this context \f* and \add then\add* judge fairly\f + \fr 1:16 \ft Or “righteously” \f* between a man and between his brother and between ⸤his opponent who is a resident alien⸥.\f + \fr 1:16 \ft Literally “between his resident alien/non-Israelite who dwells temporarily among Israel” \f* 
\v 17 You must not ⸤be partial⸥\f + \fr 1:17 \ft Literally “recognize faces” \f* ⸤in your judgment⸥; \f + \fr 1:17 \ft Literally “in the process of rendering a judgment” \f* hear \add out\add* the small \add person\add* as \add also\add* the great \add person\add*; ⸤do not be intimidated by any person⸥,\f + \fr 1:17 \ft Literally “do not fear before the faces of \fq any \ft man” \f* because the judgment \add is\add* God’s; and the case that is too difficult\f + \fr 1:17 \ft Or “hard” \f* for you, bring \add it\add* to me, and I will hear it \add out\add*.’ 
\v 18 And so I instructed you at that time \add concerning\add* all \add of\add* the things that you should do.
\p 
\v 19 “Then we set out from Horeb, and we went \add through\add* the whole \add of\add* that great and terrible desert that you saw \add on\add* the way \add to\add* the hill country of the Amorites\f + \fr 1:19 \ft Hebrew “Amorite” \f* as Yahweh our God had commanded us, and \add so\add* we came up to Kadesh Barnea. 
\v 20 I said to you, ‘⸤You have reached⸥\f + \fr 1:20 \ft Literally “You have come up to” \f* the hill country of the Amorites\f + \fr 1:20 \ft Hebrew “Amorite” \f* that Yahweh our God \add is\add* giving to us. 
\v 21 See, Yahweh your God has set before you the land; go up and possess \add it\add* as Yahweh the God of your ancestors\f + \fr 1:21 \ft Or “fathers” \f* said to you; do not fear and do not be dismayed.’
\p 
\v 22 “Then all of you approached me, and \add you\add* said, ‘Let us send men ⸤before us⸥,\f + \fr 1:22 \ft Literally “before our faces” or “ahead of us” \f* and let them explore the land for us, and let them bring back ⸤a report⸥\f + \fr 1:22 \ft Literally “a word” \f* to us \add concerning\add* the way that ⸤we should take⸥\f + \fr 1:22 \ft Literally “we should go up by it” \f* \add and concerning\add* the cities that we shall come to.’ 
\v 23 The plan was good ⸤in my opinion⸥,\f + \fr 1:23 \ft Literally “in my eyes” \f* and \add so\add* I took from \add among\add* you twelve men, ⸤one from each tribe⸥.\f + \fr 1:23 \ft Literally “man one from the tribe” \f* 
\v 24 And they ⸤set out⸥\f + \fr 1:24 \ft Literally “turned” \f* and ⸤went up into the hill country⸥,\f + \fr 1:24 \ft Literally “went up toward the hill \fq country \ft mountain” \f* and they went up to the wadi\f + \fr 1:24 \ft A valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season \f* of Eschol, and they spied out \add the land\add*. 
\v 25 They took in their hands\f + \fr 1:25 \ft Hebrew “hand” \f* ⸤some of the fruit⸥\f + \fr 1:25 \ft Literally “from the fruit” \f* of the land, and they brought \add it\add* down to us, and they brought to us back ⸤a report⸥,\f + \fr 1:25 \ft Literally “a word” \f* and they said, ‘The land that Yahweh our God \add is\add* giving to us \add is\add* good.’ 
\v 26 But you were not willing to go up, and you rebelled against the ⸤command⸥\f + \fr 1:26 \ft Literally “mouth” \f* of Yahweh your God. 
\v 27 And you grumbled in your tents, and you said, ‘Because of the hatred of Yahweh \add toward\add* us he has brought us out from the land of Egypt to give us into the hand of the Amorites\f + \fr 1:27 \ft Hebrew “Amorite” \f* to destroy us. 
\v 28 Where \add can\add* we go up? Our brothers have ⸤made our hearts melt⸥,\f + \fr 1:28 \ft Literally “caused to melt our hearts” \f* ⸤saying⸥,\f + \fr 1:28 \ft Literally “to say” \f* “The people are greater\f + \fr 1:28 \ft Or “bigger” \f* and taller than we are,\f + \fr 1:28 \ft Hebrew “than us” \f* \add and there are\add* great fortified cities \add reaching\add* up to heaven, and we saw the sons of the Anakites \add living\add* there.” ’
\p 
\v 29 “And so I said to you, ‘Do not be terrified, and do not fear them. 
\v 30 Yahweh your God, who is going ⸤before you⸥,\f + \fr 1:30 \ft Literally “to your faces” \f* will himself\f + \fr 1:30 \ft The Hebrew pronoun indicates emphasis \f* fight for you, ⸤just as⸥\f + \fr 1:30 \ft Literally “like all that” \f* he did for you in Egypt before your eyes, 
\v 31 and \add just as he did\add* in the wilderness\f + \fr 1:31 \ft Or “desert” \f* when\f + \fr 1:31 \ft Or “where” \f* you saw that\f + \fr 1:31 \ft Or “how” \f* Yahweh your God carried you, just as someone\f + \fr 1:31 \ft Or “a man” \f* carries his son, all \add along\add* the way \add that\add* you traveled until ⸤you reached⸥\f + \fr 1:31 \ft Literally “you came” \f* this place.’ 
\v 32 But through all of this you did not trust in Yahweh your God, 
\v 33 ⸤who goes⸥\f + \fr 1:33 \ft Literally “\fq is \ft the one going” \f* ⸤before you⸥\f + \fr 1:33 \ft Literally “before your faces” \f* on your\f + \fr 1:33 \ft Hebrew “the” \f* way, seeking a place for your encampment, in fire at night and in a cloud by day, to show you the way that ⸤you should go⸥.\f + \fr 1:33 \ft Literally “you should go in it” \f*
\p 
\v 34 “Then Yahweh heard the sound of your words, and he was angry, and he swore, ⸤saying⸥,\f + \fr 1:34 \ft Literally “to say” \f* 
\v 35 ‘No one of these men\f + \fr 1:35 \ft The beginning of an oath in Hebrew; the text emphatically denies anyone of that evil generation the privilege of seeing the promised land \f* of this evil generation will see the good land that I swore to give to your ancestors,\f + \fr 1:35 \ft Or “fathers” \f* 
\v 36 except Caleb, the son of Jephunneh; he himself\f + \fr 1:36 \ft Emphatic use of the pronoun \f* shall see it, and to him I will give the land upon which he has trodden and to his sons\f + \fr 1:36 \ft Or “descendants” \f* because ⸤he followed Yahweh unreservedly⸥.’\f + \fr 1:36 \ft Literally “he filled \fq his hands \ft after Yahweh” \f* 
\v 37 Even with me Yahweh was angry because of you, saying, ‘Not even you shall enter there. 
\v 38 Joshua, the son of Nun, ⸤your assistant⸥,\f + \fr 1:38 \ft Literally “the one standing before you” \f* will go there; encourage him because he will cause Israel to inherit it. 
\v 39 And your little children, who you thought shall become plunder, and your sons, who do not today know good or bad, shall themselves\f + \fr 1:39 \ft The Hebrew pronoun is used for emphasis \f* go there, and I will give it to them, and they shall take possession of it. 
\v 40 But you turn and set out \add in the direction of\add* the wilderness by way of the ⸤Red Sea⸥.’\f + \fr 1:40 \ft Literally “sea of reeds” \f*
\p 
\v 41 “You replied and said to me, ‘We have sinned against Yahweh, \add and now\add* we will go up and fight according to all that Yahweh our God commanded us’; and \add so\add* each man fastened on ⸤his battle gear⸥,\f + \fr 1:41 \ft Literally “his vessels of battle” \f* and you regarded \add it\add* as easy to go up \add into\add* the hill country. 
\v 42 So Yahweh said to me, ‘Say to them, “You shall not go up, and you shall not fight because I am not in your midst; you will be defeated ⸤before⸥\f + \fr 1:42 \ft Literally “in the faces of your enemies” \f* your enemies.” ’ 
\v 43 So I spoke to you, but you did not listen; you rebelled against the ⸤command of Yahweh⸥;\f + \fr 1:43 \ft Literally “mouth of Yahweh” \f* you behaved presumptuously, and you went up into the hill country. 
\v 44 The Amorites living in the hill country went out ⸤to oppose you⸥\f + \fr 1:44 \ft Literally “to meet you” \f* and chased you as \add a swarm of\add* wild honey bees do; and \add so\add* they ⸤beat⸥\f + \fr 1:44 \ft Literally “cut” \f* you down in Seir as far as Hormah. 
\v 45 So you returned and wept ⸤before Yahweh⸥;\f + \fr 1:45 \ft Literally “before the faces of Yahweh” \f* but Yahweh did not listen to your voice and did not pay \add any\add* attention to you. 
\v 46 You stayed in Kadesh many days; such were the days that you stayed \add there\add*.
\c 2
\p 
\v 1  “\add Then\add* we turned and set out \add toward\add* the wilderness\f + \fr 2:1 \ft Or “desert” \f* in the direction of the ⸤Red Sea⸥,\f + \fr 2:1 \ft Literally “sea of reeds” \f* as Yahweh told me, and we went around Mount Seir \add for\add* many days. 
\v 2 Yahweh spoke to me, ⸤saying⸥,\f + \fr 2:2 \ft Literally “to say” \f* 
\v 3 ‘\add Long\add* enough you have been skirting this mountain; turn yourselves north, 
\v 4 and instruct\f + \fr 2:4 \ft Or “command” \f* the people, ⸤saying⸥,\f + \fr 2:4 \ft Literally “to say” \f* “You \add are\add* about to cross \add through\add* the territory of your brothers, the descendants\f + \fr 2:4 \ft Or “sons” \f* of Esau, who are living in Seir; they will be afraid of you, and \add so\add* be very careful. 
\v 5 Do not get involved in battle\f + \fr 2:5 \ft Or “provoke” \f* with them, for I will not give you any of their land, not even ⸤a foot’s breadth⸥\f + \fr 2:5 \ft Literally “a sole’s foot of space” \f* \add of it\add*; since I have given Mount Seir \add as\add* a possession for Esau. 
\v 6 You shall buy food from them so that you may eat; and also you shall purchase water from them with money so that you may drink. 
\v 7 The fact of the matter is, Yahweh your God has blessed you in ⸤all the work you have done⸥;\f + \fr 2:7 \ft Literally “the work of your hand” \f* he knows ⸤your travels⸥\f + \fr 2:7 \ft Literally “your journeying” \f* \add with respect to\add* this great wilderness; forty years Yahweh your God \add has been\add* with you; you have not lacked a thing.” ’ 
\v 8 And so we passed by our brothers, the descendants\f + \fr 2:8 \ft Or “sons” \f* of Esau, who live in Seir, past the road of the Arabah,\f + \fr 2:8 \ft Or “Jordan Valley” since the Arabah is an extension of it \f* from Elath and Ezion Geber, and we turned and traveled along the route of the desert\f + \fr 2:8 \ft Or “wilderness” \f* of Moab.
\p 
\v 9 And Yahweh said to me, ‘You shall not attack Moab, and you shall not engage in war\f + \fr 2:9 \ft Or “battle” \f* with them, for I will not give you any of his land \add as\add* a possession; I have given Ar to the descendants\f + \fr 2:9 \ft Or “sons” \f* of Lot \add as\add* a possession.’ 
\v 10 (The Emim previously lived in it, a people large,\f + \fr 2:10 \ft Or “great” in the sense of influential \f* numerous, and tall, like the Anakites. 
\v 11 They were reckoned also \add as\add* Rephaim as the Anakites \add were\add*; but the Moabites called them Emim. 
\v 12 The Horites previously lived in Seir, but the descendants\f + \fr 2:12 \ft Or “sons” \f* of Esau dispossessed them and destroyed them ⸤from among themselves⸥,\f + \fr 2:12 \ft Literally “from their presence” \f* as Israel did with respect to the land of their\f + \fr 2:12 \ft Literally “its/his” \f* possession that Yahweh gave to them.) 
\v 13 So \add now\add* arise and cross over the wadi\f + \fr 2:13 \ft A valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season \f* of Zered yourselves; and \add so\add* we crossed the wadi\f + \fr 2:13 \ft A valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season \f* of Zered. 
\v 14 Now the ⸤length of time⸥\f + \fr 2:14 \ft Literally “days” \f* that we had traveled from Kadesh Barnea until \add the time when\add* we crossed the wadi\f + \fr 2:14 \ft A valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season \f* of Zered \add was\add* thirty-eight years, until the perishing of all of that generation; \add that is\add*, the men of war from the midst of the camp as Yahweh had sworn to them. 
\v 15 The hand of Yahweh was against them to root them out from the midst of the camp until they perished completely.
\p 
\v 16 “⸤And then⸥\f + \fr 2:16 \ft Literally “And it happened” \f* when all the men of war\f + \fr 2:16 \ft Or “battle” \f* ⸤had died⸥\f + \fr 2:16 \ft Literally “had finished/completed to die” \f* from among the people, 
\v 17 Yahweh spoke to me, ⸤saying⸥,\f + \fr 2:17 \ft Literally “to say” \f* 
\v 18 ‘You \add are\add* about to cross over the boundary of Moab ⸤today⸥\f + \fr 2:18 \ft Literally “the day” \f* at Ar. 
\v 19 When you approach ⸤the border of⸥\f + \fr 2:19 \ft Literally “opposite” \f* the ⸤Ammonites⸥,\f + \fr 2:19 \ft Literally “the sons/children of Ammon” \f* you shall not harass them, and you shall not get involved in battle with them, for I have not given the land of ⸤the Ammonites⸥\f + \fr 2:19 \ft Literally “the sons/children of Ammon” \f* to you as a possession; because I have given it to the descendants\f + \fr 2:19 \ft Or “sons” \f* of Lot \add as\add* a possession. 
\v 20 It is also considered the land of Rephaim; Rephaim lived in it ⸤previously⸥,\f + \fr 2:20 \ft Literally “before” \f* and the Ammonites called them Zamzummim, 
\v 21 a people great and numerous and as tall as the Anakites; Yahweh destroyed them from before them,\f + \fr 2:21 \ft That is, the Ammonites \f* and they dispossessed them and settled in place of them, 
\v 22 just as he did for the descendants\f + \fr 2:22 \ft Or “sons” \f* of Esau, who live in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from ⸤before them⸥\f + \fr 2:22 \ft Literally “from the face/presence of them” \f* and dispossessed them, and \add then\add* they settled in their\f + \fr 2:22 \ft Hebrew “them” \f* place up to this day. 
\v 23 And \add also\add* the Avvites, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, \add and the\add* Caphtorim, who came out from Caphtor, destroyed them and \add then\add* settled in their place. 
\v 24 Arise,\f + \fr 2:24 \ft Or “Get up” \f* set out and cross \add over\add* the wadi\f + \fr 2:24 \ft A valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season \f* of Arnon. Look! I have given Sihon the Amorite, the king of Heshbon, and his land into your hand; begin to take possession of \add it\add*, and engage with him in battle. 
\v 25 This day I will begin to place ⸤the dread of you⸥\f + \fr 2:25 \ft Literally “your dread” \f* and the fear of you ⸤before⸥\f + \fr 2:25 \ft Literally “upon the faces of” \f* the peoples under all the heavens. \add They\add* will hear ⸤the report about you⸥,\f + \fr 2:25 \ft Literally “your report” \f* and \add so\add* they will shake and tremble ⸤because of you⸥.’ \f + \fr 2:25 \ft Literally “from before you” \f*
\p 
\v 26 “So I sent messengers from the wilderness\f + \fr 2:26 \ft Or “desert” \f* of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon; \add I sent\add* terms of peace, ⸤saying⸥,\f + \fr 2:26 \ft Literally “to say” \f* 
\v 27 ‘Let me cross through your land \add and\add* ⸤only along the road⸥\f + \fr 2:27 \ft Literally “in the road, in the road” \f* I will go; I will not turn aside to the right or \add to the\add* left. 
\v 28 Food for money you shall sell me, so that I may eat, and water for money you will give to me, so that I may drink; just let me cross on foot. 
\v 29 \add Just as\add* the descendants\f + \fr 2:29 \ft Or “the children/sons of” \f* of Esau did for me, who live in Seir, and the Moabites, who live in Ar, until I cross the Jordan into the land that Yahweh our God is giving to us.’ 
\v 30 But Sihon king of Heshbon was not willing to let us cross through his \add territory\add* because Yahweh your God hardened his spirit and ⸤made him obstinate⸥\f + \fr 2:30 \ft Literally “made firm his heart” \f* ⸤in order to give him⸥\f + \fr 2:30 \ft Literally “to give him,” indicating purpose \f* into your hand, ⸤just as he has now done⸥.\f + \fr 2:30 \ft Literally “as \fq it is \ft this day” \f* 
\v 31 Yahweh said to me, ‘Look! I have begun to give ⸤over to you⸥\f + \fr 2:31 \ft Literally “to the face of you” \f* Sihon and his land; begin ⸤to take possession of his land⸥.’\f + \fr 2:31 \ft Literally, “take possession in order to possess his land” \f* 
\v 32 Then Sihon and all his people came out to meet us for battle at Jahaz. 
\v 33 And so Yahweh our God gave him over ⸤to us⸥,\f + \fr 2:33 \ft Literally “before us” \f* and we struck him down, and his sons\f + \fr 2:33 \ft Or “descendants” \f* and all of his people. 
\v 34 So we captured all of his cities at that time, and we destroyed each town \add of\add* males and the women and the children; we did not leave behind a survivor. 
\v 35 We took only the livestock as spoil for ourselves,\f + \fr 2:35 \ft Hebrew “us” \f* and \add also\add* the booty of the cities that we had captured. 
\v 36 From Aroer, which \add is\add* on the edge of the wadi\f + \fr 2:36 \ft A valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season \f* of Arnon and the city that \add was\add* in the wadi\f + \fr 2:36 \ft A valley that is dry most of the year, but contains a stream during the rainy season \f* on up to Gilead, \add there\add* was not a city that was inaccessible to us; Yahweh our God gave ⸤everything⸥\f + \fr 2:36 \ft Literally “the whole” \f* ⸤to us⸥.\f + \fr 2:36 \ft Literally “before us” \f* 
\v 37 Only the land of ⸤the Ammonites⸥\f + \fr 2:37 \ft Literally “children/sons of Ammon” \f* you did not approach, \add all along\add* the whole upper region of the Jabbok ⸤River⸥\f + \fr 2:37 \ft Literally “wadi,” which here refers to a flowing river \f* and the towns of the hill country, \add according to all\add* that Yahweh our God had instructed.

\v 1  “Then we turned, and we went up the road to Bashan, and Og the king of Bashan came out to meet us, he and all \add of\add* his army for the battle \add at\add* Edrei. 
\v 2 And Yahweh said to me, ‘You should not fear him, for I have given him and all \add of\add* his army\f + \fr 3:2 \ft Or “people” \f* and his land into your hand. And \add so\add* you will do to him as you did to Sihon the king of the Amorites,\f + \fr 3:2 \ft Hebrew “Amorite” \f* who \add was\add* reigning in Heshbon.’ 
\v 3 And \add so\add* Yahweh our God also gave Og the king of Bashan, and all of his army\f + \fr 3:3 \ft Or “people” \f* into our hand, and we struck him down until not a survivor remained to\f + \fr 3:3 \ft Or “for” \f* him.

\q1 
\v 16 They made him jealous with strange \add gods\add*;
