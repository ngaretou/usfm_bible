\cl Psalm 1
\s1 The Ways of the Righteous and the Wicked
\q1 
\v 1 Blessed is the man who does not walk in the advice of \add the\add* wicked;
\q1 nor does he stand in \add the\add* way of sinners;
\q1 nor does he sit in \add the\add* assembly of mockers.
\q1 
\v 2 Instead, in the law of Yahweh \add is\add* his delight,
\q1 and on his law he meditates day and night.
\q1 
\v 3 And so, he is like a tree planted by streams of water
\q1 that gives its fruit in its season;
\q1 its leaf also does not wither.
\q1 Therefore all that he does prospers.
\q1 
\v 4 Not so the wicked.
\q1 Instead, \add they are\add* like the chaff that \add the\add* wind scatters.
\q1 
\v 5 Therefore \add the\add* wicked will not stand in the judgment,
\q1 nor sinners in the congregation of \add the\add* righteous;
\q1 
\v 6 for Yahweh knows \add the\add* way of \add the\add* righteous,\f + \fr 1:6 \ft Plural \f*
\q1 but \add the\add* way of \add the\add* wicked will perish.

\cl Psalm 2
\s1 The Messiah’s Reign

\q1 against Yahweh and his anointed:
\q1 
\v 3 “Let us tear off their bonds,
\q1 and cast their cords from us!”
\q1 
\v 4 \add He who\add* sits \add enthroned\add* in the heavens laughs.
\q1 The Lord derides them.
\q1 
\v 5 Then he speaks to them in his wrath,
\q1 and in his fury he terrifies them:
\q1 
\v 6 “But as for me, I have set my king
\q1 on Zion, my holy mountain.”
\q1 
\v 7 I will tell the decree;
\q1 Yahweh said to me:
\q1 “You are my son;
\q1 today I have begotten you.
\q1 
\v 8 Ask from me and I will make \add the\add* nations your heritage,
\q1 and your possession \add the\add* ends of \add the\add* earth.
\q1 
\v 9 You will break them with an iron rod.
\q1 Like a potter’s vessel you will shatter them.”
\q1 
\v 10 So then, O kings, be wise.
\q1 Be warned, O rulers of \add the\add* earth.
\q1 
\v 11 Serve Yahweh with fear,
\q1 and rejoice with trembling.
\q1 
\v 12 Kiss the Son
\q1 lest he be angry and you perish \add on the\add* way,
\q1 for his anger burns quickly.
\q1 Blessed are all \add who\add* take refuge in him.
