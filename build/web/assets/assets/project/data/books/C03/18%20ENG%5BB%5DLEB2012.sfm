\s1 Job’s Character and Greatness
\m 
\v 1 \add There\add* was a man in the land of Uz whose\f + \fr 1:1 \ft Hebrew “his” \f* name \add was\add* Job. That\f + \fr 1:1 \ft Hebrew “And that” \f* man was blameless and upright and God-fearing and turning away from evil. 
\v 2 And seven sons and three daughters were born to him. 
\v 3 Then\f + \fr 1:3 \ft Hebrew “And” \f* his livestock came to be seven thousand sheep and goats and three thousand camels and five hundred pairs\f + \fr 1:3 \ft Hebrew “pair” \f* of oxen and five hundred female donkeys, and he had very many slaves, and that man was greater than all the people of the east. 
\v 4 And his sons used to go and hold a feast ⸤at each other’s house⸥\f + \fr 1:4 \ft Literally “at the house of a man,” or “at the house of each” \f* on his day, and they would send, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and to drink with them. 
\v 5 ⸤Then when⸥\f + \fr 1:5 \ft Literally “And it would happen that,” or “And it would happen when” \f* the days of the feast had run their course, ⸤Job would send⸥,\f + \fr 1:5 \ft Literally “and Job would send” \f* and he would sanctify them. Thus\f + \fr 1:5 \ft Hebrew “And” \f* he would arise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings \add according to\add* the number of all of them, because Job thought,\f + \fr 1:5 \ft Or “said” \f* “Perhaps my children have sinned and ⸤cursed⸥\f + \fr 1:5 \ft Literally “blessed”— negative meaning by context \f* God in their heart.” This is what Job used to do ⸤all the time⸥.\f + \fr 1:5 \ft Or “always”; literally “all the days” \f*
\p 
\v 6 And it happened ⸤one day⸥\f + \fr 1:6 \ft Literally “the day” \f* ⸤that⸥\f + \fr 1:6 \ft Literally “and” \f* the sons of God\f + \fr 1:6 \ft Or “the heavenly beings,” or “the angels” \f* came to present themselves before Yahweh, and Satan\f + \fr 1:6 \ft Hebrew “the accuser,” or “the adversary” \f* also came into their midst. 
\v 7 So\f + \fr 1:7 \ft Hebrew “And” \f* Yahweh said to Satan,\f + \fr 1:7 \ft Hebrew “the accuser,” or “the adversary” \f* “From where have you come?”
\p Then\f + \fr 1:7 \ft Hebrew “And” \f* Satan\f + \fr 1:7 \ft Hebrew “the accuser,” or “the adversary” \f* answered Yahweh and said, “From roaming on the earth and from walking about in it.”
\p 
\v 8 So\f + \fr 1:8 \ft Hebrew “And” \f* Yahweh said to Satan,\f + \fr 1:8 \ft Hebrew “the accuser,” or “the adversary” \f* “Have you ⸤considered⸥\f + \fr 1:8 \ft Literally “set your heart” \f* my servant Job? Indeed,\f + \fr 1:8 \ft Or “For,” or “Because” \f* there is no one like him on the earth—a blameless man and upright and God-fearing and turning away from evil.”
\p 
\v 9 Then\f + \fr 1:9 \ft Hebrew “And” \f* Satan\f + \fr 1:9 \ft Hebrew “the accuser,” or “the adversary” \f* answered Yahweh and said, “Does Job fear God for nothing? 
\v 10 Have you\f + \fr 1:10 \ft Emphatic personal pronoun could be translated “you yourself” \f* not put a fence around him and his household and around ⸤all that belongs to him⸥\f + \fr 1:10 \ft Literally “all that \fq is \ft his” \f* ⸤on every side⸥?\f + \fr 1:10 \ft Literally “from around” \f* You have blessed the work of his hands, and his livestock\f + \fr 1:10 \ft Or “possessions” \f* has increased in the land. 
\v 11 But,\f + \fr 1:11 \ft Hebrew “And” \f* on the other hand, stretch out\f + \fr 1:11 \ft Or “please” \f* your hand and touch ⸤all that belongs to him⸥\f + \fr 1:11 \ft Literally “all that \fq is \ft his” \f* \add and see\add* ⸤whether⸥\f + \fr 1:11 \ft Literally “if not” \f* he will ⸤curse⸥\f + \fr 1:11 \ft Literally “bless”— negative meaning by context \f* you to your face.”
\p 
\v 12 So\f + \fr 1:12 \ft Hebrew “And” \f* Yahweh said to Satan,\f + \fr 1:12 \ft Hebrew “the accuser,” or “the adversary” \f* “Look, ⸤all that belongs to him⸥\f + \fr 1:12 \ft Literally “all that \fq is \ft his” \f* is in your ⸤power⸥.\f + \fr 1:12 \ft Literally “hand” \f* Only do not stretch out your hand ⸤against⸥\f + \fr 1:12 \ft Literally “to,” or “unto” \f* him.” So\f + \fr 1:12 \ft Hebrew “And” \f* Satan\f + \fr 1:12 \ft Hebrew “the accuser,” or “the adversary” \f* went out from Yahweh’s ⸤presence⸥.\f + \fr 1:12 \ft Literally “faces of” \f*
\s1 The Adversary’s Attack on Job’s Possessions
\m 
\v 13 And then \add there\add* was one day when\f + \fr 1:13 \ft Hebrew “and” \f* his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their firstborn brother’s house. 
\v 14 And a messenger came to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing, and the female donkeys were feeding ⸤beside them⸥.\f + \fr 1:14 \ft Literally “on their hands” \f* 
\v 15 Then\f + \fr 1:15 \ft Hebrew “And” \f* the Sabeans ⸤attacked⸥,\f + \fr 1:15 \ft Literally “fell \fq upon them \ft ” \f* and they took them, and they slew the servants ⸤by the edge of the sword⸥.\f + \fr 1:15 \ft Literally “with the mouth of \fq the \ft sword” \f* But\f + \fr 1:15 \ft Hebrew “And” \f* I escaped, \add even\add* I alone, to tell you.”
\p 
\v 16 While this one was still speaking, ⸤another⸥\f + \fr 1:16 \ft Literally “this” \f* came and said, “The fire of God fell from the heavens, and it blazed up against the sheep and goats and against the servants, and it consumed them. But I escaped, \add even\add* I alone, to tell you.”
\p 
\v 17 While this one was still speaking, ⸤another⸥\f + \fr 1:17 \ft Literally “this” \f* came and said, “The Chaldeans formed three divisions, and they made a raid on the camels, and they carried them away, and they struck your servants ⸤by the edge of the sword⸥,\f + \fr 1:17 \ft Literally “with the mouth of \fq the \ft sword” \f* but I escaped, \add even\add* I alone, to tell you.”
\p 
\v 18 At the time\f + \fr 1:18 \ft Hebrew “Until” \f* this one was speaking, ⸤another⸥\f + \fr 1:18 \ft Literally “this” \f* came and said, “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their firstborn brother’s house. 
\v 19 And behold,\f + \fr 1:19 \ft Or “Look” \f* a great wind came from across the desert, and it struck the four corners of the house ⸤so that⸥\f + \fr 1:19 \ft Literally “and” \f* it fell upon the young people, and they died. But I escaped, \add even\add* I alone, to tell you.”
\p 
\v 20 Then\f + \fr 1:20 \ft Hebrew “And” \f* Job arose and tore his outer garment\f + \fr 1:20 \ft Or “robe” \f* and shaved his head; ⸤then⸥\f + \fr 1:20 \ft Hebrew “and” \f* he fell upon the ground and he worshiped. 
\v 21 Then\f + \fr 1:21 \ft Hebrew “And” \f* he said, “Naked I came out from my mother’s womb, and naked I will return there. Yahweh gives, and Yahweh takes. Let Yahweh’s name be blessed.” 
\v 22 In all this, Job did not sin and did not ⸤charge God with wrongdoing⸥.\f + \fr 1:22 \ft Literally “give unseemliness to God” \f*

\s1 The Adversary’s Attack on Job’s Person
\m 
\v 1 ⸤And then⸥\f + \fr 2:1 \ft Literally “And it came to be,” or “and it happened” \f* one day the sons of God\f + \fr 2:1 \ft Or “the heavenly beings,” or “the angels” \f* came to present themselves before Yahweh, and Satan\f + \fr 2:1 \ft Hebrew “the accuser,” or “the adversary” \f* also came into their midst to present himself before Yahweh. 
\v 2 So\f + \fr 2:2 \ft Hebrew “And” \f* Yahweh ⸤asked⸥\f + \fr 2:2 \ft Literally “said to” \f* Satan,\f + \fr 2:2 \ft Hebrew “the accuser,” or “the adversary” \f* “From where have you come?”
\p And Satan\f + \fr 2:2 \ft Hebrew “the accuser,” or “the adversary” \f* answered Yahweh and said, “From roaming on the earth and from walking about in it.”
\p 
\v 3 So\f + \fr 2:3 \ft Hebrew “And” \f* Yahweh ⸤asked⸥\f + \fr 2:3 \ft Literally “said to” \f* Satan,\f + \fr 2:3 \ft Hebrew “the accuser,” or “the adversary” \f* “Have you ⸤considered⸥\f + \fr 2:3 \ft Literally “set your heart” \f* my servant Job? Indeed,\f + \fr 2:3 \ft Or “For” or “Because” \f* there is no one like him on the earth—a blameless man and upright and God-fearing and turning away from evil. And still he persists in his blamelessness ⸤even though⸥\f + \fr 2:3 \ft Hebrew “and” \f* you incited me against him to destroy him for nothing.”
\p 
\v 4 Then\f + \fr 2:4 \ft Hebrew “And” \f* Satan\f + \fr 2:4 \ft Hebrew “the accuser,” or “the adversary” \f* answered him and said, “Skin for skin! All that ⸤that⸥\f + \fr 2:4 \ft Literally “the” \f* man has he will give for his life. 
\v 5 But stretch out\f + \fr 2:5 \ft Or “please” \f* your hand and touch his bones and his flesh, \add and see\add* ⸤whether⸥\f + \fr 2:5 \ft Literally “if not” \f* he will ⸤curse⸥\f + \fr 2:5 \ft Literally “bless”—negative meaning by context \f* you to your face.”\f + \fr 2:5 \ft Hebrew “your faces” \f*
\p 
\v 6 So\f + \fr 2:6 \ft Literally “And it happened the/one day” \f* Yahweh said to Satan,\f + \fr 2:6 \ft Hebrew “the accuser,” or “the adversary” \f* “⸤All right⸥,\f + \fr 2:6 \ft Literally “Look” \f* he \add is\add* in your ⸤power⸥.\f + \fr 2:6 \ft Literally “hand” \f* Only spare his life.”
\s1 Job’s Blameless Behavior
\m 
\v 7 So\f + \fr 2:7 \ft Hebrew “And” \f* Satan\f + \fr 2:7 \ft Hebrew “the accuser,” or “the adversary” \f* went out from ⸤Yahweh’s presence⸥,\f + \fr 2:7 \ft Literally “the faces of Yahweh” \f* and he inflicted Job with loathsome skin sores from the sole of his foot up to the crown of his head. 
\v 8 ⸤So⸥\f + \fr 2:8 \ft Hebrew “And” \f* he took for himself a potsherd with which to scrape himself, and he sat in the midst of the ashes.
\p 
\v 9 Then\f + \fr 2:9 \ft Hebrew “And” \f* his wife said to him, “Are you still persisting in your blamelessness? ⸤Curse⸥\f + \fr 2:9 \ft Literally “Bless”—negative meaning by context \f* God and die.”
\p 
\v 10 So\f + \fr 2:10 \ft Hebrew “And” \f* he said to her, “You speak like one of the foolish women speaks. Indeed, should we receive the good from God, but\f + \fr 2:10 \ft Or “and” \f* not receive the evil?” In all this, Job did not sin with his lips.
\p 
\v 11 Thus\f + \fr 2:11 \ft Hebrew “And” \f* Job’s three friends heard of this calamity that had come upon him. So\f + \fr 2:11 \ft Hebrew “And” \f* each set out from his \add own\add* place: Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite. And they met\f + \fr 2:11 \ft Or “they agreed” \f* together to come to console him and to comfort him.
\p 
\v 12 Thus\f + \fr 2:12 \ft Hebrew “And” \f* they lifted up their eyes\f + \fr 2:12 \ft Or “they gazed” \f* from afar, but\f + \fr 2:12 \ft Hebrew “and” \f* they did not recognize him, so\f + \fr 2:12 \ft Hebrew “and” \f* they raised their voice, and they wept, and each man tore his outer garment\f + \fr 2:12 \ft Or “robe” \f* and threw dust on their heads ⸤toward the sky⸥.\f + \fr 2:12 \ft Or “in the air”; literally “to the heavens” \f* 
\v 13 Then\f + \fr 2:13 \ft Hebrew “And” \f* they sat with him on the ground \add for\add* seven days and seven nights, but\f + \fr 2:13 \ft Hebrew “and” \f* no one spoke\f + \fr 2:13 \ft Or “there was no speaking” \f* a word to him because they saw that ⸤his⸥\f + \fr 2:13 \ft Literally “the” \f* suffering was very great.

\s1 Job Regrets His Birth
\m 
\v 1 ⸤Afterward⸥\f + \fr 3:1 \ft Literally “After thus” \f* Job opened his mouth and cursed\f + \fr 3:1 \ft A different term than that employed in 1:5, 11; 2:5, 9 \f* his day. 
\v 2 Thus\f + \fr 3:2 \ft Hebrew “And” \f* Job ⸤spoke up⸥\f + \fr 3:2 \ft Literally “answered” \f* and said,
\sd0
\q1 
\v 3 “Let \add the\add* day perish on which I was born,
\q1 and the night that said, ‘A man-child is conceived.’
\q1 
\v 4 Let that day become\f + \fr 3:4 \ft Or “be” \f* darkness;
\q1 may God not seek it from above,
\q1 nor may daylight shine on it.
\q1 
\v 5 Let darkness and deep shadow claim it;
\q1 let clouds\f + \fr 3:5 \ft Literally “cloud” \f* settle on it;
\q1 let them\f + \fr 3:5 \ft Masculine plural referring to all three entities mentioned in this verse \f* terrify it \add with the\add* blackness\f + \fr 3:5 \ft Literally “blacknesses” \f* of day.
\q1 
\v 6 Let darkness seize that night;\f + \fr 3:6 \ft Literally “That night, let darkness seize it” \f*
\q1 let it not rejoice among \add the\add* days of \add the\add* year;
\q1 let it not enter among \add the\add* number of \add the\add* months.
\q1 
\v 7 Look, let that night become\f + \fr 3:7 \ft Or “be” \f* barren;
\q1 let a joyful song not enter it.
\q1 
\v 8 Let those who curse the day curse it,
\q1 those who are skilled at rousing Leviathan.
\q1 
\v 9 Let the stars of its dawn be dark;
\q1 let it hope for light but\f + \fr 3:9 \ft Hebrew “and” \f* there be none,
\q1 and let it not see \add the\add* eyelids of dawn
\q1 
\v 10 because it did not shut the doors of my \add mother’s\add* womb,
\q1 nor\f + \fr 3:10 \ft Hebrew “And” \f* did it hide trouble from my eyes.

\s1 Job Wishes He Had Died

\q1 
\v 11 “Why did I not die at\f + \fr 3:11 \ft Literally “from” \f* birth?
\q1 \add Why\add* did I \add not\add* come forth from \add the\add* womb and expire?
\q1 
\v 12 Why did \add the\add* knees receive me

\q1 
\v 13 For now I would lie down, and I would be at peace;
\q1 I would be asleep; then ⸤I would be at rest⸥\f + \fr 3:13 \ft Literally “it would be at rest for me” \f*

\q1 who fill up their houses \add with\add* silver.
\q1 
\v 16 Or \add why\add* was I not hidden like a miscarriage,

\v 17 There \add the\add* wicked cease from troubling,
\q1 and there \add the\add* ⸤weary⸥\f + \fr 3:17 \ft Literally “weary of strength” \f* are at rest;

\q1 
\v 19 \add The\add* small and \add the\add* great \add are\add* there,
\q1 and \add the\add* slave \add is\add* free from his masters.\f + \fr 3:19 \ft Or “master” \f*

\s1 Job Wishes He Might Die

\q1 
\v 1 “Call now, is there \add anyone\add* answering you?
\q1 And to which of \add the\add* holy ones will you turn?
\q1 
\v 2 For vexation will slay the fool,

\q1 
\v 3 I have seen a fool taking root,
\q1 but\f + \fr 5:3 \ft Hebrew “And” \f* suddenly I cursed his dwelling.
\q1 
\v 4 His children are far from deliverance,
\q1 and they are crushed in the gate,

\q1 
\v 6 Indeed,\f + \fr 5:6 \ft Or “For” \f* mischief does not come from the dust,
\q1 and trouble does not sprout from the earth.
\q1 
\v 7 But a human being is born to trouble,

\q1 
\v 12 \add He\add* is frustrating \add the\add* devices of \add the\add* crafty,
\q1 and their hands do not achieve success.
\q1 
\v 13 \add He\add* is capturing \add the\add* wise in their craftiness,
