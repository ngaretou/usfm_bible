\s1 Woes Pronounced on Unrepentant Towns

\v 20 Then he began to reproach the towns in which the majority of his miracles had been done, because they did not repent: 
\v 21 “Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. 
\v 22 Nevertheless I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and for Sidon on the day of judgment than for you!
