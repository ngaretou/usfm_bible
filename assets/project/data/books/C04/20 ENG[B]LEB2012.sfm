\s1 Lecture Against Gang Behavior
\sd0
\q1 
\v 8 My child, may you keep\f + \fr 1:8 \ft Or “obey,” or “hear” \f* your father’s instruction,
\q2 and do not reject your mother’s teachings,
\q1 
\v 9 for they \add are\add* a garland of favor for your head,
\q2 and pendants for your neck.
\q1 
\v 10 My child, if sinners entice you, do not consent.
\q1 
\v 11 If they say,
\q2 “Come with us!
\q2 We shall lie in wait for blood;
\q2 we shall ambush the innocent without cause.\f + \fr 1:11 \ft Or “wantonly,” or “for nothing” \f*
\q1 
\v 12 Like Sheol,\f + \fr 1:12 \ft A term for the place where the dead reside, i.e., the Underworld \f* we will swallow them alive
\q2 and whole, ⸤like those who descend to the pit⸥.\f + \fr 1:12 \ft Literally “like the descenders of a pit” \f*
\q1 
\v 13 We shall find all precious wealth,
\q2 we shall fill our houses \add with\add* booty,
\q1 
\v 14 you shall throw your lot in our midst,
\q2 there will be one purse for all of us.”
\q1 
\v 15 My child, do not walk in their way.\f + \fr 1:15 \ft Or “on their road” \f*
\q2 Keep your foot from their paths,
\q1 
\v 16 for their feet run to evil,
\q2 and they hurry to shed blood,
\q1 
\v 17 for “in vain\f + \fr 1:17 \ft Or “without cause,” or “for nothing” \f* is the net scattered,
\q2 in the sight of any ⸤winged bird⸥.”\f + \fr 1:17 \ft Literally “bird of wing” \f*
\q1 
\v 18 They lie in wait for their \add own\add* blood.
\q2 They ambush their \add own\add* lives.
\q1 
\v 19 Thus are the ways of all who are greedy \add for\add* gain—
\q2 it will take the life of its possessors.

\s1 The Call of Lady Wisdom
\sd0
\q1 
\v 20 Wisdom calls out in the streets,
\q2 in the squares she raises her voice.
\q1 
\v 21 On a ⸤busy corner⸥\f + \fr 1:21 \ft Literally “head of commotion,” or “head of stirring, bustling” \f* she cries out,
\q2 at the entrances of the gates in the city, she speaks her sayings:
\q1 
\v 22 “⸤How long⸥,\f + \fr 1:22 \ft Literally “Until when” \f* O simple ones, will you love simplicity?
\q2 And \add how long\add* will scoffers delight in their scoffing,
\q2 and fools hate knowledge?
\q1 
\v 23 May you turn to my argument!\f + \fr 1:23 \ft Or “turn at my reproach” \f*
\q2 Behold, I shall pour out my spirit upon you;
\q2 I will make my words known to you.
\q1 
\v 24 Because I called out and you refused me,
\q2 I stretched out my hand, yet there is none who heeds.
\q1 
\v 25 You have ignored all my counsel,
\q2 and my reproof you are not willing \add to accept\add*.
\q1 
\v 26 I will also laugh at your calamity;\f + \fr 1:26 \ft Or “downfall” \f*
\q2 I will mock when panic\f + \fr 1:26 \ft Or “dread, fear” \f* comes \add upon\add* you.
\q1 
\v 27 When your panic comes like a storm,
\q2 and your calamity arrives like a whirlwind,
\q2 when distress and anguish come upon you,
\q1 
\v 28 then they will call\f + \fr 1:28 \ft Or “cry out \fq to \ft ” \f* me, but I will not answer;
\q2 they will seek me diligently but not find me.
\q1 
\v 29 Since they hated knowledge,
\q2 and did not choose the fear of Yahweh,
\q1 
\v 30 they were not willing \add to accept\add* my counsel,
\q2 they despised all my reproof.
\q1 
\v 31 They shall eat from the fruit of their way,
\q2 and they shall be sated from their own schemes,
\q1 
\v 32 for the waywardness of the simple ones will kill them,
\q2 and the complacency of fools will destroy them.
\q1 
\v 33 Whoever listens to me will dwell in security
\q2 and rest securely\f + \fr 1:33 \ft Or “be at ease, peace” \f* from dread and disaster.”

\s1 The Benefits of Wisdom
\sd0
\q1 
\v 1 My child, if you will receive\f + \fr 2:1 \ft Or “take, seize” \f* my sayings,
\q2 and hide my commands with you,
\q1 
\v 2 \add in order\add* to incline your ear toward wisdom,
\q2 \add then\add* you shall apply your heart to understanding.
\q1 
\v 3 For if you cry out for understanding,\f + \fr 2:3 \ft Or “call to understanding” \f*
\q2 \add if\add* you lift\f + \fr 2:3 \ft Or “carry, give” \f* your voice for insight,
\q1 
\v 4 if you seek her like silver
\q2 and search her out ⸤like treasure⸥,\f + \fr 2:4 \ft Literally “like the treasures” \f*
\q1 
\v 5 then you will understand the fear of Yahweh,
\q2 and the knowledge of God you will find.
\q1 
\v 6 For Yahweh will give wisdom;
\q2 from his mouth \add come\add* knowledge and understanding.
\q1 
\v 7 For the upright, he stores\f + \fr 2:7 \ft Or “hides, keeps” \f* sound judgment, a shield for those who walk uprightly,
\q1 
\v 8 \add in order\add* to guard paths of justice
\q2 and keep\f + \fr 2:8 \ft Or “preserve, guard, watch” \f* the way of his faithful \add ones\add*.
\q1 
\v 9 Then you will understand righteousness and justice
\q2 and uprightness—every good course—
\q1 
\v 10 for wisdom will enter your heart,
\q2 and knowledge will be pleasing to your soul.\f + \fr 2:10 \ft Or “inner self” \f*
\q1 
\v 11 Discretion will watch over you;
\q2 understanding will protect you,
\q1 
\v 12 \add in order\add* to deliver you from the way of evil,\f + \fr 2:12 \ft Or “evildoer” \f*
\q2 from a man who speaks devious things—
\q1 
\v 13 those who forsake the paths of uprightness
\q2 to walk in ways of darkness,
\q1 
\v 14 those who are happy to do evil,
\q2 \add for\add* they delight in \add the\add* deviousness of evil,
\q1 
\v 15 ⸤who are crooked in their ways⸥,\f + \fr 2:15 \ft Literally “that \fq in \ft their ways are crooked” \f*
\q2 and devious in their paths;
\q1 
\v 16 \add in order\add* to deliver you from a strange woman,
\q2 from a foreign woman \add who\add* flatters\f + \fr 2:16 \ft Or “makes smooth” \f* \add with\add* her sayings,
\q1 
\v 17 she who forsakes the partner of her youth
\q2 and has forgotten the covenant of her God,
\q1 
\v 18 for her house sinks to death,
\q2 and to the dead\f + \fr 2:18 \ft Or “Rephaim” \f* are her paths.
\q1 
\v 19 \add Of\add* all who go to her, none shall return,
\q2 nor do they reach paths of life.
\q1 
\v 20 So that you will walk on the road of those who are good,
\q2 and the paths of those who are righteous you shall keep.
\q1 
\v 21 For those who are upright will dwell \add in the\add* land,\f + \fr 2:21 \ft Or “earth” \f*
\q2 and those who are blameless\f + \fr 2:21 \ft Or “innocent” \f* will remain in it.
\q1 
\v 22 And those who are wicked will be cut off from the land,
\q2 and those who are treacherous will be uprooted from it.

\q1 
\v 3 May loyal love\f + \fr 3:3 \ft Or “kindness, mercy” \f* and truth not forsake you;

\q2 in the eyes of God and humankind.

\q2 do not lean toward your own understanding.
\q1 
\v 6 In all your ways acknowledge him,

\v 8 There shall be healing for your ⸤flesh⸥,\f + \fr 3:8 \ft Literally “navel” \f*
\q2 and refreshment for your body.

\q1 
\v 10 and your barns shall be full of plenty,
\q2 and your vats shall burst \add with\add* new wine.
\sd0
\s1 Happy Is the One Who Finds Wisdom
\sd0
\q1 
\v 11 Do not despise the discipline of Yahweh, my child.
\q2 Do not be weary of his reproof
\q1 
\v 12 because whomever Yahweh will love, he will rebuke,
\q2 as a father delights in his son.
\q1 
\v 13 Happy \add is\add* ⸤the one⸥\f + \fr 3:13 \ft Literally “a man” \f* who finds wisdom,
\q2 and one who obtains understanding.
\q1 
\v 14 For her\f + \fr 3:14 \ft Or “its”; both “wisdom” and “understanding” are feminine nouns and can be read as either “she” or “it” \f* income is better than the income of silver,
\q2 and her revenue than \add that of\add* gold.
\q1 
\v 15 She is more precious than rubies,
\q2 and all your desires shall not compare with her.
\q1 
\v 16 Length of days \add is\add* in her right hand;
\q2 in her left hand \add are\add* riches and honor.
\q1 
\v 17 Her ways \add are\add* ways of pleasantness,
\q2 and all her paths \add are\add* peace.
\q1 
\v 18 She is a tree of life for those who seize her;
\q2 those who take hold of her are considered happy.
\sd0
\s1 Role of Wisdom in Creation and Society
\sd0
\q1 
\v 19 Yahweh in wisdom founded the earth;
\q2 he established the heavens in understanding.
\q1 
\v 20 With his knowledge, depths broke open,
\q2 and clouds dropped dew.
\q1 
\v 21 My child, may they\f + \fr 3:21 \ft Grammatically, “they” most likely refers to clouds (3:20). In context, “they” may refer to wisdom and understanding (3:13). \f* not escape from your ⸤sight⸥;\f + \fr 3:21 \ft Literally “eyes” \f*
\q2 may you keep sound wisdom and prudence.
\q1 
\v 22 They shall be life for your soul\f + \fr 3:22 \ft Or “inner self” \f*
\q2 and adornment\f + \fr 3:22 \ft Or “favor” \f* for your neck.
\q1 
\v 23 Then you will walk in the confidence of your ways,
\q2 and your foot will not stumble.
\q1 
\v 24 If you sit down, you will not panic,\f + \fr 3:24 \ft Or “fear, dread” \f*
\q2 and \add if\add* you lie down, then your sleep shall be sweet.
\q1 
\v 25 Do not be afraid of sudden panic,\f + \fr 3:25 \ft Or “fear, dread” \f*
\q2 or the storm of wickedness that will come.
\q1 
\v 26 Yahweh will be ⸤your confidence⸥\f + \fr 3:26 \ft Literally “in your confidence” \f*
\q2 and guard your foot from capture.
\q1 
\v 27 Do not withhold good from its owner\f + \fr 3:27 \ft Or “lord” \f*
\q2 when it is in the power of your hand to do.
\q1 
\v 28 Do not say to your neighbor,
\q2 “Go and return and tomorrow I will give \add it\add*,”
\q2 ⸤when it is with you⸥.\f + \fr 3:28 \ft Literally “and there is with you” \f*
\q1 
\v 29 Do not plot harm against your neighbor
\q2 \add who\add* dwells in confidence beside you.
\q1 
\v 30 Do not quarrel with anyone without cause,
\q2 when he did not do you harm.
\q1 
\v 31 Do not envy a man of violence,
\q2 and do not choose any of his ways,
\q1 
\v 32 for he who is perverse \add is\add* an abomination of Yahweh,
\q2 but those who are upright \add are\add* his confidence.
\q1 
\v 33 The curse of Yahweh \add is\add* on the house of the wicked,
\q2 and the abode of the righteous ones he blesses.
\q1 
\v 34 With those who scorn, he is scornful,
\q2 but to those who are humble, he gives favor.
\q1 
\v 35 They will inherit the honor of the wise,
\q2 but stubborn fools, disgrace.

\s1 The Father’s Wisdom
\sd0
\q1 
\v 1 Children, listen \add to the\add* instruction of a father,
\q2 and be attentive \add in order\add* to know insight.
\q1 
\v 2 For I have given you good instruction;
\q2 do not forsake my teaching.
\q1 
\v 3 When I was a son to my father,
\q2 tender and alone before my mother,
\q1 
\v 4 he taught me and said to me,
\q2 “May your heart hold fast \add to\add* my words;
\q2 guard my commandments and live.
\q1 
\v 5 Get wisdom and insight;
\q2 do not forget and do not turn from the sayings of my mouth.
\q1 
\v 6 Do not forsake her—then she will guard you;
\q2 love her and she will keep you.
\q1 
\v 7 The beginning of wisdom: Get wisdom!
\q2 With all \add that is in\add* your possession, gain insight.
\q1 
\v 8 Cherish her and she will exalt you;
\q2 she will honor you if you embrace her.
\q1 
\v 9 She will give a garland for your head;
\q2 she shall bestow a crown of glory upon you.”
\sd0
\s1 The Right Path
\sd0
\q1 
\v 10 Listen, my child, take my sayings,
\q2 and \add the\add* years of your life shall be great.
\q1 
\v 11 In the way of wisdom I have instructed you;

\q1 
\v 12 ⸤When you walk⸥,\f + \fr 4:12 \ft Literally “In your walking” \f* your step will not be hampered,
\q2 and if you run, you will not stumble.
\q1 
\v 13 Seize the instruction! Do not let go!
\q2 Guard her, for she is your life.
\q1 
\v 14 In the path of the wicked do not go;
\q2 do not walk in the way of those who do evil.
\q1 
\v 15 Avoid it; do not transgress it;
\q2 turn away from it and pass by.
\q1 
\v 16 For they will not sleep if they have not done wrong,
\q2 and they are robbed of their sleep if they do not cause stumbling.
\q1 
\v 17 For they ate the bread of wickedness,
\q2 and they drank the wine of violence.
\q1 
\v 18 But the path of the righteous ones \add is\add* like the light of dawn,
\q2 leading and shining until the day ⸤is full⸥.\f + \fr 4:18 \ft Literally “\fq is \ft correct” \f*
\q1 
\v 19 The way of the wicked ones \add is\add* like deep darkness;
\q2 they do not know what they stumble over.
\sd0
\s1 Staying the Course
\sd0
\q1 
\v 20 My child, be attentive to my words;
\q2 to my sayings incline your ear.
\q1 
\v 21 May they not escape from your ⸤sight⸥;\f + \fr 4:21 \ft Literally “eyes” \f*
\q2 keep them in \add the\add* midst of your heart.
\q1 
\v 22 For they are life to those who find them
\q2 and healing ⸤to the entire body⸥.\f + \fr 4:22 \ft Literally “for all his flesh” \f*
\q1 
\v 23 With all vigilance, keep your heart,
\q2 for from it \add comes\add* the source\f + \fr 4:23 \ft Or “extremity” \f* of life.
\q1 
\v 24 Remove from yourself ⸤deceitful speech⸥,\f + \fr 4:24 \ft Literally “crookedness of mouth” \f*
\q2 and abolish ⸤devious talk⸥\f + \fr 4:24 \ft Literally “deviousness of lips” \f* from yourself.
\q1 
\v 25 May your eyes look forward\f + \fr 4:25 \ft Or “opposite” \f*
\q2 and your gaze be straight before you.
\q1 
\v 26 May the path of your foot be balanced
\q2 and all your ways be sure.
\q1 
\v 27 Do not swerve right or left;
\q2 remove your foot from evil.
\sd0
\c 5
\sd0
\q1 
\v 1  My child, be attentive to my wisdom,
\q2 and to my understanding incline your ear;
\q1 
\v 2 \add in order\add* to keep prudence,
\q2 and knowledge will guard your lips.
\q1 
\v 3 For the lips of the strange woman will drip honey,
\q2 and smoother than oil is her mouth.\f + \fr 5:3 \ft Or “palate” \f*
\q1 
\v 4 But her end is bitter as the wormwood,
\q2 sharp as a two-edged sword.
\q1 
\v 5 Her feet go down \add to\add* death;
\q2 her steps take hold \add of\add* Sheol.\f + \fr 5:5 \ft A term for the place where the dead reside, i.e., the Underworld \f*
\q1 
\v 6 She does not observe\f + \fr 5:6 \ft Or “examine, weigh” \f* the path of life;
\q2 her ways wander, \add and\add* she does not know \add it\add*.
\sd0
\s1 Do Not Commit Adultery Against Wisdom
\sd0
\q1 
\v 7 Now, O children, listen to me;
\q2 do not depart from the sayings of my mouth.
\q1 
\v 8 Keep your paths far from her,
\q2 and do not go near to the door of her house,
\q1 
\v 9 lest you give your honor to the others,
\q2 and your years to the merciless,
\q1 
\v 10 lest strangers take \add their\add* fill of your strength,
\q2 and your labors \add go\add* to the house of a foreigner,
\q1 
\v 11 and you groan at your end,
\q2 when your flesh and body are consumed,
\q1 
\v 12 and say “How I hated discipline,
\q2 and I despised reproof!”
\q1 
\v 13 and “I did not listen to the voice of my teachers,
\q2 and I did not incline my ear to my instructors!
\q1 
\v 14 I was almost at utter\f + \fr 5:14 \ft Or “all, every, whole” \f* ruin\f + \fr 5:14 \ft Or “evil” \f*
\q2 in the midst of the assembly and congregation.”
\q1 
\v 15 Drink water from your \add own\add* cistern
\q2 and flowing waters from inside your own well.
\q1 
\v 16 Shall your springs be scattered outward?
\q2 In the streets, \add shall there be\add* streams of water?
\q1 
\v 17 May they be yours alone,
\q2 and not for strangers \add who are\add* with you.
\q1 
\v 18 May your fountain be blessed,
\q2 and rejoice in the wife\f + \fr 5:18 \ft Or “woman” \f* of your youth.
\q1 
\v 19 \add She is\add* a deer of love and a doe of grace;
\q2 may her breasts satisfy you ⸤always⸥;\f + \fr 5:19 \ft Literally “at all time” \f*
\q2 by her love may you be intoxicated continually.
\q1 
\v 20 Why should you be intoxicated, my child, by a strange woman,
\q2 and embrace the bosom of a foreigner?
\q1 
\v 21 For before the eyes of Yahweh \add are\add* ⸤human ways⸥,\f + \fr 5:21 \ft Literally “the ways of man/humankind” \f*
\q2 and all his paths he examines.
\q1 
\v 22 His iniquities shall ensnare him, the evildoer,
\q2 and in the vanity of his sin he shall be caught.
\q1 
\v 23 He shall die ⸤for lack of⸥\f + \fr 5:23 \ft Literally “with there is no” \f* discipline,
\q2 and in the greatness of his folly he shall be lost.

\q2 Go, humble yourself, plead with your neighbor.
\q1

\q1 
\v 8 In the summer, it prepares its food;
\q2 in the harvest, it gathers its sustenance.
\q1 
\v 9 How long will you lie down, lazy?
\q2 When will you rise up from your sleep?
\q1 
\v 10 A little sleep, a little slumber,
\q2 a little folding of the hands for rest—
\q1 
\v 11 like a ⸤robber⸥\f + \fr 6:11 \ft Literally “one who walks,” that is, a vagabond \f* shall your poverty come,

\q1 
\v 13 Winking in his eye, shuffling in his foot,

\v 14 perversion in his heart, he devises evil;
\q2 at all times he will send out discord.\f + \fr 6:14 \ft Or “quarrels” \f*
\q1 
\v 15 Upon ⸤such a man⸥,\f + \fr 6:15 \ft Literally “thus” \f* suddenly shall his calamity come;
\q2 in a moment he will be damaged and there is no healing.\f + \fr 6:15 \ft Or “repair” \f*
\sd0
\s1 What Yahweh Hates

\q1 
\v 16 There are six \add things\add* Yahweh hates,

\q1 
\v 17 haughty eyes, a lying tongue,
