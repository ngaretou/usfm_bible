\s1 Yahweh Appoints Jeremiah as a Prophet to the Nations
\m 
\v 1 The words of Jeremiah, the son of Hilkiah, among the priests who \add were\add* in Anathoth, in the land of Benjamin, 
\v 2 \add to\add* whom the word of Yahweh came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, the king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign. 
\v 3 It came also in the days of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, until the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, until the exile of Jerusalem in the fifth month.
\p 
\v 4 And the word of Yahweh came to me, ⸤saying⸥,\f + \fr 1:4 \ft Literally “to say” \f*
\sd0
\q1 
\v 5 “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you,
\q1 and before you came out from \add the\add* womb I consecrated you;
\q1 I appointed you \add as\add* a prophet to the nations.”
\sd0
\p 
\v 6 Then I said, “Ah, Lord Yahweh! Look, I do not know \add how\add* to speak, for I \add am\add* a youth.”\f + \fr 1:6 \ft Or “boy” \f* 
\v 7 But Yahweh said to me, “You must not say, ‘I \add am\add* a youth,’\f + \fr 1:7 \ft Or “boy” \f* for to ⸤whomever⸥\f + \fr 1:7 \ft Literally “all of whom” \f* I send you, you will go, and ⸤whatever⸥\f + \fr 1:7 \ft Literally “all of that” \f* I command you, you will speak. 
\v 8 ⸤Do not be afraid of them⸥,\f + \fr 1:8 \ft Literally “you must not be afraid from the faces of them” \f* for I \add am\add* with you to deliver you,” ⸤declares⸥\f + \fr 1:8 \ft Literally “declaration of” \f* Yahweh. 
\v 9 Then Yahweh stretched out his hand and he touched my mouth, and Yahweh said to me,
\sd0
\q1 “Look, I have put my words in your mouth.
\q1 
\v 10 See, I appoint you this day over the nations
\q1 and over the kingdoms,
\q1 to pluck up and to pull down,
\q1 and to destroy and to tear down,
\q1 to build and to plant.”

\s1 Yahweh Confirms Jeremiah’s Call
\m 
\v 11 And the word of Yahweh came to me, ⸤saying⸥,\f + \fr 1:11 \ft Literally “to say” \f* “What \add are\add* you seeing, Jeremiah?” And I said, “I \add am\add* seeing a branch of an almond tree.” 
\v 12 Then Yahweh said to me, “You did well to see, for I \add am\add* watching over my word to perform it.” 
\v 13 And the word of Yahweh came to me a second \add time\add*, ⸤saying⸥,\f + \fr 1:13 \ft Literally “to say” \f* “What \add are\add* you seeing?” And I said, “I \add am\add* seeing a ⸤boiling⸥\f + \fr 1:13 \ft Literally “blown upon” \f* pot, and its face \add is\add* from \add the\add* face of \add the\add* north.” 
\v 14 Then Yahweh said to me, “From \add the\add* north disaster will be unleashed\f + \fr 1:14 \ft Or “opened” \f* on all the inhabitants of the land. 
\v 15 For, look, I \add am\add* calling to all \add the\add* clans\f + \fr 1:15 \ft Or “families” \f* of \add the\add* kingdoms of \add the\add* north,” ⸤declares⸥\f + \fr 1:15 \ft Literally “a declaration of” \f* Yahweh, “and they will come and set each one his throne \add at\add* the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all its surrounding walls, and against all the cities of Judah. 
\v 16 And I will pass\f + \fr 1:16 \ft Or “pronounce” \f* my judgments on them because of all their wickedness \add in\add* that they have forsaken me, and they made sacrifices to other gods, and they bowed in worship to the works of their hands. 
\v 17 But you, you must gird your loins, and stand, and speak to them all that I command you. ⸤Do not be afraid of them⸥,\f + \fr 1:17 \ft Literally “You must not be filled with terror from the faces of them” \f* or I will shatter you ⸤before⸥\f + \fr 1:17 \ft Literally “to the faces of” \f* them. 
\v 18 Now look, I have made you ⸤today⸥\f + \fr 1:18 \ft Literally “the day” \f* as a fortified city and as an iron pillar and a bronze wall\f + \fr 1:18 \ft Hebrew “walls” \f* against all the land, against the kings of Judah, against its princes, against its priests, and against the people of the land. 
\v 19 And they will fight against you but they will not prevail against you, for I \add am\add* with you,” ⸤declares⸥\f + \fr 1:19 \ft Literally “a declaration of” \f* Yahweh, “to deliver you.”

\s1 Yahweh Remembers Israel’s Faithfulness
\m 
\v 1 And the word of Yahweh came to me, ⸤saying⸥,\f + \fr 2:1 \ft Literally “to say” \f* 
\v 2 “Go and proclaim in the ears of Jerusalem, ⸤saying⸥,\f + \fr 2:2 \ft Literally “to say” \f* ‘Thus says Yahweh,
\sd0
\q1 “I remember \add concerning\add* you the loyal love of your childhood,\f + \fr 2:2 \ft Or “youth” \f*
\q2 the love of your betrothal-time,
\q1 your going\f + \fr 2:2 \ft Or “walking” \f* after me in the desert,\f + \fr 2:2 \ft Or “wilderness” \f*
\q2 in \add the\add* land not sown.
\q1 
\v 3 Israel \add was\add* holy to Yahweh,
\q2 the first fruit of his produce.
\q1 All \add those who\add* ate it were held guilty;
\q2 disaster came to them,” ⸤declares⸥\f + \fr 2:3 \ft Literally “a declaration of” \f* Yahweh.’ ”
\sd0
\s1 The Unfaithfulness of Israel’s Ancestors
\m 
\v 4 Hear the word of Yahweh, \add O\add* house of Jacob, and all the clans\f + \fr 2:4 \ft Or “families” \f* of the house of Israel. 
\v 5 Thus says Yahweh:
\sd0
\q1 “What injustice did your ancestors\f + \fr 2:5 \ft Or “fathers” \f* find in me
\q2 that they were far from me,
\q1 and they went after the vanity,
\q2 and they became vain?
\q1 
\v 6 And they did not say,
\q2 ‘Where \add is\add* Yahweh,
\q1 the one who brought us up from the land of Egypt,
\q2 the one who led us in the desert,\f + \fr 2:6 \ft Or “wilderness” \f*
\q1 in a land of desert plains and gorges,\f + \fr 2:6 \ft Hebrew “gorge” \f*
\q2 in a land of dryness and deep darkness,
\q1 in a land ⸤that no one passes through⸥,\f + \fr 2:6 \ft Literally “no man passes through in it” \f*
\q2 and no human lives there?’
\q1 
\v 7 And I brought you to the land of the orchard,
\q2 to eat its fruit, and its good things.\f + \fr 2:7 \ft Hebrew “good thing” \f*
\q1 But you entered and defiled my land,
\q2 and my inheritance you made a detestable thing.\f + \fr 2:7 \ft Or “abomination” \f*
\q1 
\v 8 The priests did not say, ‘Where \add is\add* Yahweh?’
\q2 and those who handle the law did not know me,
\q1 and the shepherds have ⸤rebelled against me⸥,\f + \fr 2:8 \ft Literally “broken with me” \f*
\q2 and the prophets prophesied by Baal,
\q1 and they went after \add things which\add* do not profit.
\sd0
\s1 The Unfaithfulness of Contemporary Israel
\sd0
\q1 
\v 9 ⸤Therefore⸥\f + \fr 2:9 \ft Literally “To thus” \f* I again bring a lawsuit against you,” ⸤declares⸥\f + \fr 2:9 \ft Literally “a declaration of” \f* Yahweh,
\q2 “and with ⸤your children⸥\f + \fr 2:9 \ft Literally “sons of your sons” \f* I bring a lawsuit.
\q1 
\v 10 For go over \add to\add* the coasts of Cyprus and look,
\q2 and send \add to\add* Kedar and consider very closely,
\q2 and see if there has been \add a thing\add* like this:
\q1 
\v 11 Has a nation exchanged gods? And they \add are\add* not gods!
\q2 But my people have exchanged their glory for that which does not profit.
\q1 
\v 12 Be appalled, \add O\add* heavens, at this, and shudder;
\q2 be utterly desolate,” ⸤declares⸥\f + \fr 2:12 \ft Literally “a declaration of” \f* Yahweh.
\q1 
\v 13 “For my people have committed two evils:
\q2 they have forsaken me, \add the\add* source\f + \fr 2:13 \ft Or “fountain” \f* of living water,
\q2 to hew out for themselves cisterns, cracked cisterns that can hold no water.
\q1 
\v 14 \add Is\add* Israel a slave? Or ⸤a slave born in a house⸥?\f + \fr 2:14 \ft Literally “born of a house” \f*
\q2 Why has he become plunder?
\q1 
\v 15 \add The\add* young lions have roared against him,
\q2 they have ⸤raised⸥\f + \fr 2:15 \ft Literally “given” \f* their voices.\f + \fr 2:15 \ft Hebrew “voice” \f*
\q1 And they have made his land as horror;
\q2 his cities are destroyed, ⸤without⸥\f + \fr 2:15 \ft Literally “from not” \f* an inhabitant.
\q1 
\v 16 Moreover, people of Memphis and Tahpanhes
\q2 will ⸤shave⸥\f + \fr 2:16 \ft Literally “pasture” \f* your skull.\f + \fr 2:16 \ft Or “crown of your head” \f*
\q1 
\v 17 Did you not do this to yourself,
\q2 \add by\add* forsaking Yahweh, your God,
\q2 at the time of your leading in the way?
\q1 
\v 18 And now ⸤why do you go⸥\f + \fr 2:18 \ft Literally “what for you” \f* the way of Egypt
\q2 to drink the waters of the Shihor?
\q1 And ⸤why do you go⸥\f + \fr 2:18 \ft Literally “what for you” \f* the way of Assyria
\q2 to drink the waters of the ⸤Euphrates⸥?\f + \fr 2:18 \ft Literally “river” \f*
\q1 
\v 19 Your wickedness will chastise you,
\q2 and your apostasies will reprove you.
\q1 Therefore know and see that \add it is\add* evil and bitter,
\q2 your forsaking of Yahweh, your God,
\q1 and fear of me \add is\add* not in you,”
\q2 ⸤declares⸥\f + \fr 2:19 \ft Literally “a declaration of” \f* the Lord, Yahweh of hosts.
\q1 
\v 20 “For from long ago you have broken your yoke,
\q2 you tore to pieces your bonds.
\q1 And you said, ‘I will not serve!’
\q2 But on every high hill and under every leafy tree
\q2 you \add were\add* lying down \add as\add* a prostitute.
\q1 
\v 21 Yet I planted you \add as\add* a choice vine,
\q2 all of it a seed of trustworthiness.
\q1 How then have you altered before me
\q2 \add into something that is\add* degenerate, the foreign vine?
\q1 
\v 22 For if you wash with natron,
\q2 and you ⸤use much soap⸥,\f + \fr 2:22 \ft Literally “make numerous for yourself alkaline salt” \f*
\q1 your guilt \add is\add* sticking as a stain ⸤before⸥\f + \fr 2:22 \ft Literally “to the face of” \f* me,”
\q2 ⸤declares⸥\f + \fr 2:22 \ft Literally “a declaration of” \f* the Lord Yahweh.
\q1 
\v 23 “How can you say, ‘I have not defiled myself,
\q2 I have not gone after the Baals?’
\q1 Look at your way in the valley,
\q2 know what you have done.
\q1 \add You are\add* a young she-camel,
\q2 interweaving her ways.
\q1 
\v 24 A wild ass accustomed to \add the\add* desert,\f + \fr 2:24 \ft Or “wilderness” \f*
\q2 in the desire of her soul.
\q1 She gasps \add for\add* wind \add in\add* her rutting time.
\q2 Who can quell\f + \fr 2:24 \ft Or “restrain” \f* her \add lust\add*?
\q1 All \add those who\add* seek her will not grow weary,
\q2 in her month they will find her.
\q1 
\v 25 Restrain your foot from \add being\add* barefoot,
\q2 and your throat from thirst.
\q1 But you said, ‘\add It is\add* hopeless.
\q2 No! For I have loved strangers,
\q2 and after them I will go.’\f + \fr 2:25 \ft Or “walk” \f*
\q1 
\v 26 As \add the\add* shame of a thief when he is caught in the act,
\q2 so the house of Israel will be ashamed.
\q1 They, their kings, their officials,
\q2 and their priests, and their prophets.
\q1 
\v 27 \add Those who\add* say to the tree, ‘You \add are\add* my father,’
\q2 and to the stone, ‘You gave birth \add to\add* me.’
\q1 For they have turned \add their\add* ⸤backs⸥\f + \fr 2:27 \ft Literally “neck” \f* to me, and not \add their\add* faces.
\q2 But in the time of their trouble they say, ‘Arise and save us.’
\q1 
\v 28 But where \add are\add* your gods that you made for yourself?
\q2 Let them arise if they can save you in the time of your trouble.
\q1 For \add according to\add* the number of your towns
\q2 are your gods, \add O\add* Judah.
\q1 
\v 29 Why do you complain to me?
\q2 All of you have ⸤rebelled against me⸥,”\f + \fr 2:29 \ft Literally “broken with me” \f* ⸤declares⸥\f + \fr 2:29 \ft Literally “a declaration of” \f* Yahweh.
\q1 
\v 30 “For ⸤in vain⸥\f + \fr 2:30 \ft Literally “the vanity” \f* I have struck your children.
\q2 They accepted no discipline.
\q1 Your sword devoured your prophets,
\q2 like a ravening\f + \fr 2:30 \ft Or “destroying” \f* lion.
\q1 
\v 31 O generation, you see the word of Yahweh.
\q2 Have I been a desert\f + \fr 2:31 \ft Or “wilderness” \f* to Israel? Or a land of great darkness?
\q1 Why do my people say, ‘We roam about freely,
\q2 we will not come again to you’?
\q1 
\v 32 Can a young woman forget her ornaments?\f + \fr 2:32 \ft Or “jewelry” \f* \add Or\add* a bride her sashes?
\q2 Yet my people have forgotten me days without number.
\q1 
\v 33 How well you do \add on\add* your way to seek love!
\q2 ⸤Therefore⸥\f + \fr 2:33 \ft Literally “To thus” \f* even \add to\add* the wicked \add woman\add* you can teach your ways.
\q1 
\v 34 Also on your skirts is found
\q2 \add the\add* blood of \add the\add* life of \add the\add* innocent, \add the\add* poor.
\q1 You did not find them in the act of breaking into a house.
\q2 But in spite of all these \add things\add*,
\q1 
\v 35 yet you say, ‘But I am innocent,
\q2 surely his anger has turned away from me.’
\q1 Look, I \add am\add* entering into judgment with you
\q2 because of your saying, ‘I have not sinned.’
\q1 
\v 36 How you go about so much changing your way!
\q2 Also by Egypt you will be put to shame,
\q2 just as you were put to shame by Assyria.
\q1 
\v 37 Also from there you will come out
\q2 with your hands on your head,
\q1 for Yahweh has rejected ⸤those in whom you trust⸥,\f + \fr 2:37 \ft Literally “in your objects of trust” \f*
\q2 and you will not prosper through them.

\q1 
\v 1  A ⸤saying⸥:\f + \fr 3:1 \ft Literally “to say” \f* ‘Look, \add if\add* a man divorces his wife,
\q2 and she goes from him ⸤and she becomes another man’s wife⸥,\f + \fr 3:1 \ft Literally “and she becomes to a man another” \f*
\q2 will he return to her again?’
\q1 Will not that land be greatly defiled?
\q1 And you have prostituted \add yourself\add* \add with\add* many lovers,
\q2 \add would\add* you now return to me?” ⸤declares⸥\f + \fr 3:1 \ft Literally “a declaration of” \f* Yahweh.
\q1 
\v 2 “Lift up your eyes at \add the\add* barren heights,
\q2 and see where you have not been ravished.
\q1 Beside the roads you sat for them like an Arab in the desert,\f + \fr 3:2 \ft Or “wilderness” \f*
\q2 and you have defiled \add the\add* land
\q1 with your fornication
\q2 and with your wickedness.
\q1 
\v 3 Therefore rain showers have been withheld,
\q2 and the spring rain has not come.
\q1 Yet ⸤you have⸥\f + \fr 3:3 \ft Literally “it is for you” \f* \add the\add* forehead of a woman prostitute,
\q2 you refuse to be ashamed.
\q1 
\v 4 Have you not just now called to me,
\q2 ‘My father, you \add are\add* the close friend of my youth?
\q1 
\v 5 Will he be angry ⸤forever⸥?\f + \fr 3:5 \ft Literally “to eternity” \f*
\q2 Will he maintain \add it\add* ⸤always⸥’?\f + \fr 3:5 \ft Literally “to duration” \f*
\q1 Look, you have spoken,

\s1 Yahweh Gives Israel a Letter of Divorce
\m 
\v 6 Then Yahweh said to me in the days of Josiah, the king, “Have you seen what apostate\f + \fr 3:6 \ft Or “unfaithful” \f* Israel has done? She has gone on every high hill and under every leafy tree and she has prostituted \add herself\add* there. 
\v 7 And I thought, ‘After her doing all these \add things\add* to me she will return,’ but she did not return. And her treacherous sister Judah saw \add it\add*.\f + \fr 3:7 \ft Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation \f* 
\v 8 And I saw that ⸤for this very reason, that⸥\f + \fr 3:8 \ft Literally “because of all” \f* on account of apostate\f + \fr 3:8 \ft Or “unfaithful” \f* Israel committing adultery I divorced her and gave the letter of divorce to her. Yet her treacherous sister Judah was not afraid and she went and prostituted \add herself\add* also. 
\v 9 And it was because of the frivolity of her fornication that she defiled the land and committed adultery with the stone and with the tree. 
\v 10 Yet even in all this her treacherous sister Judah did not return to me with all her heart, ⸤but only⸥\f + \fr 3:10 \ft Literally “but if” \f* in pretense,”\f + \fr 3:10 \ft Or “deception” \f* ⸤declares⸥\f + \fr 3:10 \ft Literally “a declaration of” \f* Yahweh.
\s1 A Call for Repentance
\m 
\v 11 Then Yahweh said to me, “Apostate\f + \fr 3:11 \ft Or “unfaithful” \f* Israel has proved herself more upright\f + \fr 3:11 \ft Or “righteous” \f* than treacherous Judah. 
\v 12 Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say,

\q1 ‘Return, apostate\f + \fr 3:12 \ft Or “unfaithful” \f* Israel,’ ⸤declares⸥\f + \fr 3:12 \ft Literally “a declaration of” \f* Yahweh.
\q1 ‘I will not cause my ⸤anger⸥\f + \fr 3:12 \ft Literally “faces” \f* to fall on you.
\q1 For I \add am\add* loyal,’ ⸤declares⸥\f + \fr 3:12 \ft Literally “a declaration of” \f* Yahweh.
\q1 ‘I will not be angry ⸤forever⸥.\f + \fr 3:12 \ft Literally “to eternity” \f*
\q1 
\v 13 Only acknowledge your guilt,
\q1 that against Yahweh your God you have rebelled,
\q1 and have scattered your ways to the strangers under every leafy tree,
\q1 and you have not obeyed my voice,’ ⸤declares⸥\f + \fr 3:13 \ft Literally “a declaration of” \f* Yahweh.”

\p 
\v 14 “Return, apostate\f + \fr 3:14 \ft Or “unfaithful” \f* children,” ⸤declares⸥\f + \fr 3:14 \ft Literally “a declaration of” \f* Yahweh. “For ⸤I am your master⸥,\f + \fr 3:14 \ft Literally “I rule over among you” \f* and I will take you one from a city and two from a clan,\f + \fr 3:14 \ft Or “family” \f* and I will bring you \add to\add* Zion. 
\v 15 Then I will give you shepherds after my own heart and they will feed you knowledge and insight. 
\v 16 And it will be when you have multiplied and become fruitful in the land in those days,” ⸤declares⸥\f + \fr 3:16 \ft Literally “a declaration of” \f* Yahweh, “they will no longer say, ‘The ark of the covenant of Yahweh.’ And ⸤it will not come to mind⸥,\f + \fr 3:16 \ft Literally “it shall not go up on heart” \f* nor will they remember it, nor will they miss \add it\add*,\f + \fr 3:16 \ft Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation \f* nor will it be made again. 
\v 17 At that time they will call Jerusalem ‘The Throne of Yahweh,’ and all the nations will be gathered to it, to the name of Yahweh, to Jerusalem, and they will no longer go after the stubbornness of their evil heart. 
\v 18 In those days the house of Judah will walk along with the house of Israel and they will come together from \add the\add* land of \add the\add* north to the land that I gave as an inheritance \add to\add* your ancestors.\f + \fr 3:18 \ft Or “fathers” \f*
\sd0
\q1 
\v 19 Then I thought, ‘How I would set you among the children,
\q2 and I would give you a land of desire,
\q1 an inheritance of \add the\add* glory of \add the\add* hosts of nations.’
\q1 And I thought, ‘You would call me, “My father,”
\q2 and you would not turn back from ⸤behind⸥\f + \fr 3:19 \ft Or “following” \f* me.’
\q1 
\v 20 However, as a wife departs treacherously from her lover,

\q1 
\v 21 “A voice \add is\add* heard on \add the\add* barren heights,

\v 22 Return, \add O\add* apostate\f + \fr 3:22 \ft Or “unfaithful” \f* children,

\q1 Surely, in Yahweh our God

\q1 
\v 24 But the shameful thing has devoured

\q2 their sons and their daughters.
\q1 
\v 25 Let us lie down in our shame,

\q1 For against Yahweh our God we have sinned,

\q1 from our youth and until this day.
\q2 and we have not obeyed the voice of Yahweh our God.’

\s1 The Unfaithful Prophets

\v 9 Concerning the prophets:
\sd0
\q1 My heart is broken in my midst.
\q2 All my bones tremble.
\q1 I have become like a drunken man,

\q1 because of Yahweh,

\q1 
\v 13 “Now in the prophets of Samaria I saw a disgusting thing.
\q2 They prophesied by Baal and they caused my people Israel to err.
\q1

\v 1 Yahweh showed me, and look, there were two baskets of figs placed ⸤before⸥\f + \fr 24:1 \ft Literally “to the face of” \f* the temple of Yahweh—after Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had deported Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, with the officials of Judah, and the craftsmen, and the smiths,\f + \fr 24:1 \ft Hebrew “smith” \f* from Jerusalem and had brought them \add to\add* Babylon.

\v 3 And Yahweh asked me, “What \add are\add* you seeing, Jeremiah?” And I said, “Figs—the good figs, very good, and the bad \add figs\add*, very bad, that cannot be eaten because of \add their\add* bad quality.”
\p 
\v 4 Then the word of Yahweh came to me, ⸤saying⸥,\f + \fr 24:4 \ft Literally “to say” \f*

\v 8 But like the bad figs that cannot be eaten because of \add their\add* bad quality—for thus says Yahweh—so I will treat Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his officials, and the remnant of Jerusalem who remain in this land, and those who live in the land of Egypt. 
\v 9 And I will make them as a terror, an evil to all the kingdoms of the earth, as a disgrace and a proverb, as a taunt and a curse, in all the places where I will drive them.

\v 12 Then Jeremiah said to all the officials and to all the people, ⸤saying⸥,\f + \fr 26:12 \ft Literally “to say” \f* “Yahweh sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that you have heard.

\p 
\v 16 Then the officials and all the people said to the priests and to the prophets, “⸤This man does not deserve⸥\f + \fr 26:16 \ft Literally “Not to this man” \f* a sentence of death, for in the name of Yahweh our God, he has spoken to us.” 
\v 17 Then men from the elders of the land arose and said to all the assembly of the people, ⸤saying⸥,\f + \fr 26:17 \ft Literally “to say” \f* 
\v 18 “Micah the Morashtite was prophesying in the days of Hezekiah, the king of Judah, and he said to all the people of Judah, ⸤saying⸥:\f + \fr 26:18 \ft Literally “to say” \f*

\p 
\v 20 Indeed, there also was a man prophesying in the name of Yahweh, Uriah, the son of Shemaiah, from Kiriath-Jearim, and he prophesied against this city and against this land like all the words of Jeremiah. 
\v 21 And when King Jehoiakim, and all his warriors, and all the officials heard his words, then the king sought to put him to death. But Uriah heard, and he was afraid, and he fled and went \add to\add* Egypt. 
\v 22 Then King Jehoiakim sent men \add to\add* Egypt. Elnathan, the son of Achbor, and men with him \add went\add* to Egypt. 
\v 23 And they brought out Uriah from Egypt and they brought him to King Jehoiakim, and he struck him down with the sword, and he threw his dead body into the burial sites of the sons of the people. 
\v 24 However, the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, so that he was not given into the hand of the people to put him to death.

\s1 Jeremiah Uses Fetters and Yokes to Illustrate His Message of Submission
\m 
\v 1 In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, ⸤saying⸥\f + \fr 27:1 \ft Literally “to say” \f*— 
\v 2 thus said Yahweh to me—“Make for yourself fetters and yokes and put them on your neck,

\v 4 And you must command them for their masters, ⸤saying⸥,\f + \fr 27:4 \ft Literally “to say” \f* ‘Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, this you shall say to your masters: 
\v 5 “I have made the earth with humankind and animals\f + \fr 27:5 \ft Hebrew “animal” \f* that \add are\add* on the face of the earth by my great power and by my outstretched arm, and I give it to whomever is right in my eyes. 
\v 6 And now I myself have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and also the animals\f + \fr 27:6 \ft Hebrew “animal” \f* of the field I have given to him to serve him.

\p 
\v 8 “But it will be \add that\add* the nation or kingdom that will not serve him, Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and that will not put his neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, I will punish that nation with the sword, and with the famine, and with the plague,” ⸤declares⸥\f + \fr 27:8 \ft Literally “a declaration of” \f* Yahweh, “until I have destroyed it with my hand. 
\v 9 And you, you must not listen to your prophets, and to your diviners, and to your dreamers, and to your interpreters of signs, and to your sorcerers who are ⸤saying⸥,\f + \fr 27:9 \ft Literally “to say” \f* ‘You will not serve the king of Babylon.’

\p 
\v 12 And I spoke words like these to Zedekiah, the king of Judah, ⸤saying⸥,\f + \fr 27:12 \ft Literally “to say” \f* “Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live. 
\v 13 Why should you die—you and your people—by the sword, by the famine, and by the plague, as Yahweh has spoken concerning the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon? 
\v 14 And you must not listen to the words of the prophets who are speaking to you, ⸤saying⸥,\f + \fr 27:14 \ft Literally “to say” \f* ‘You must not serve the king of Babylon,’ for they \add are\add* prophesying a lie to you.

\s1 The Vessels of the Temple
\m 
\v 16 Then I spoke to the priests and to all this people, ⸤saying⸥,\f + \fr 27:16 \ft Literally “to say” \f* “Thus says Yahweh, ‘You must not listen to the words of your prophets who are prophesying to you, ⸤saying⸥,\f + \fr 27:16 \ft Literally “to say” \f* “Look, the vessels of the house of Yahweh \add are\add* about to be quickly brought back from Babylon”, for they \add are\add* prophesying a lie to you.

\v 18 But if they \add are\add* prophets, and if there is with them the word of Yahweh, let them please plead with Yahweh of hosts, that the vessels that are left over in the ⸤temple⸥\f + \fr 27:18 \ft Literally “house” \f* of Yahweh, and the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem, must not go \add to\add* Babylon.’
\p 
\v 19 For thus says Yahweh of hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the stands, and concerning the rest of the vessels that are left in this city,

\s1 Hananiah, the False Prophet
\m 
\v 1 And it was in that \add same\add* year, at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah, the king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, that Hananiah, the son of Azzur, the prophet who \add was\add* from Gibeon, said to me in the house of Yahweh before the eyes of the priests and all the people, ⸤saying⸥,\f + \fr 28:1 \ft Literally “to say” \f*

\p 
\v 5 Then Jeremiah the prophet said to Hananiah the prophet before the eyes of the priests and before the eyes of all the people who were standing in the house of Yahweh, 
\v 6 and Jeremiah the prophet said, “Amen! May Yahweh do so; may Yahweh fulfill your words that you have prophesied, to bring back the vessels of the house of Yahweh and all the exiles\f + \fr 28:6 \ft Hebrew “exile” \f* from Babylon to this place.

\p 
\v 10 Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet and broke it. 
\v 11 Then Hananiah said before the eyes of all the people, ⸤saying⸥,\f + \fr 28:11 \ft Literally “to say” \f* “Thus says Yahweh, ‘This is how I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, ⸤within two years⸥,\f + \fr 28:11 \ft Literally “in still two years days” \f* from the neck of all the nations.’ ” And Jeremiah the prophet went on his way.
\p 
\v 12 And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah after Hananiah the prophet broke the yoke from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet, ⸤saying⸥,\f + \fr 28:12 \ft Literally “to say” \f* 
\v 13 “Go, and you must say to Hananiah, ⸤saying⸥,\f + \fr 28:13 \ft Literally “to say” \f* ‘Thus says Yahweh, “You have broken yoke bars of wood, but you have made in place of them yoke bars of iron.” 
\v 14 For thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, “I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all these nations, to serve Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and they will serve him, and I have even given the animals\f + \fr 28:14 \ft Hebrew “animal” \f* of the open field to him.” ’ ”
\p 
\v 15 Then Jeremiah the prophet said to Hananiah the prophet, “Please listen, Hananiah, Yahweh has not sent you, and you have made this people trust in a lie.

\v 7 And seek the prosperity of the city where I have deported you, and pray on behalf of it to Yahweh, for in its prosperity you will have prosperity.’
\p 
\v 8 For thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, ‘Do not let your prophets who \add are\add* in your midst, and your diviners, deceive you, and you must not listen to your dreams that you \add are\add* causing \add them\add* to dream.

\v 25 And even \add when\add* Elnathan, and Delaiah, and Gemariah urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them. 
\v 26 And the king commanded Jerahmeel, the son of the king, and Seraiah, the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah, the son of Abdeel, to arrest Baruch the secretary and Jeremiah the prophet, but Yahweh hid them.
\p 
\v 27 And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah after the king burned the scroll and the words that Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah, ⸤saying⸥,\f + \fr 36:27 \ft Literally “to say” \f* 
\v 28 “⸤Take again⸥\f + \fr 36:28 \ft Literally “Turn back take” \f* for yourself another scroll and write on it all the former words that were in the first scroll which Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, has burned. 
\v 29 And concerning Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, you shall say, ‘Thus says Yahweh, “You have burned this scroll, ⸤saying⸥,\f + \fr 36:29 \ft Literally “to say” \f* ‘Why have you written in it, ⸤saying⸥,\f + \fr 36:29 \ft Literally “to say” \f* “The king of Babylon will certainly come and he will destroy this land, and he will cause to disappear from it humankind and animals”?’ ”\f + \fr 36:29 \ft Hebrew “animal” \f* 
\v 30 ⸤Therefore⸥\f + \fr 36:30 \ft Literally “To thus” \f* thus says Yahweh concerning Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, “There will not be for him \add one who\add* sits on the throne of David. And his dead body will be thrown out to the heat in the day and to the frost in the night. 
\v 31 And I will punish him, and his offspring, and his servants for their guilt, and I will bring on them, and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and on the people of Judah all the disaster with which I have threatened them, but they would not listen.” ’ ” 
\v 32 Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch the son of Neriah, the secretary, and he wrote on it from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the scroll that Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, had burned in the fire, and furthermore was added to them many words like these.

\s1 The Babylonians Withdraw to Meet a Threat from Egypt
\m 
\v 1 And king Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, whom Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, had made king, reigned as king in the land of Judah in place of Coniah, the son of Jehoiakim. 
\v 2 But he and his servants and the people of the land did not listen to the words of Yahweh that he spoke by the hand of Jeremiah the prophet. 
\v 3 And king Zedekiah sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, to Jeremiah the prophet, ⸤saying⸥,\f + \fr 37:3 \ft Literally “to say” \f* “Please pray for us to Yahweh our God.” 
\v 4 Now Jeremiah \add was\add* coming and going out in the midst of the people and they had not put him \add in\add* the house of imprisonment. 
\v 5 And the army of Pharaoh had come out from Egypt, and the Chaldeans, who were laying siege to Jerusalem, heard their report and they withdrew from Jerusalem.
\p 
\v 6 And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah the prophet, ⸤saying⸥,\f + \fr 37:6 \ft Literally “to say” \f* 
\v 7 “Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, ‘This is what you shall say to the king of Judah, who sent you to me to inquire \add of\add* me, “Look, the army of Pharaoh, which set out to help you, \add is\add* going to return to his land Egypt. 
\v 8 And the Chaldeans will return, and they will fight against this city, and they will capture it, and they will burn it with fire.” ’ 
\v 9 Thus says Yahweh: ‘You must not deceive yourselves, ⸤saying⸥,\f + \fr 37:9 \ft Literally “to say” \f* “Surely the Chaldeans will go from us,” for they will not go. 
\v 10 For \add even\add* if you struck the whole army of \add the\add* Chaldeans who are fighting against you, and \add only\add* men pierced through remained among them, each one in his tent, they would rise up and they would burn this city with fire.’ ”
\s1 Jeremiah is Arrested and Put in Prison
\m 
\v 11 ⸤And then⸥,\f + \fr 37:11 \ft Literally “And it will happen” \f* at the withdrawing of the army of the Chaldeans from Jerusalem ⸤before⸥\f + \fr 37:11 \ft Literally “from the face of” \f* the army of Pharaoh, 
\v 12 Jeremiah set out from Jerusalem to go \add to\add* the land of Benjamin to receive a portion from there in the midst of the people. 
\v 13 ⸤And when⸥\f + \fr 37:13 \ft Literally “And it was” \f* he \add was\add* at the Gate of Benjamin, there \add was\add* ⸤a sentry on duty⸥\f + \fr 37:13 \ft Literally “an owner of supervision” \f* whose name \add was\add* Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah, and he seized Jeremiah the prophet, ⸤saying⸥,\f + \fr 37:13 \ft Literally “to say” \f* “You \add are\add* deserting to the Chaldeans!” 
\v 14 And Jeremiah said, “\add That is\add* a lie! I \add am\add* not deserting to the Chaldeans.” But he would not listen to him. So Irijah seized Jeremiah and brought him to the officials. 
\v 15 And the officials were angry at Jeremiah and they struck him. And they put him \add in\add* ⸤prison⸥,\f + \fr 37:15 \ft Literally “the house of the fetters” \f* \add in\add* the house of Jonathan the secretary, for they had converted it to the ⸤prison⸥\f + \fr 37:15 \ft Literally “house of the imprisonment” \f*. 
\v 16 So Jeremiah came to the ⸤dungeon⸥\f + \fr 37:16 \ft Literally “house of the cistern” \f*, even to the vaulted cells, and Jeremiah stayed there many days.
\p 
\v 17 Then King Zedekiah sent and fetched him. And the king questioned him in secrecy in his house, and he said, “Is there a word from Yahweh?” And Jeremiah said, “There is.” And he said, “You will be given into the hand of the king of Babylon.”
\p 
\v 18 Then Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, “What did I do wrong to you, or to your servants, or to this people, that you have put me in ⸤prison⸥?\f + \fr 37:18 \ft Literally “the house of the imprisonment” \f* 
\v 19 And where \add are\add* your prophets who prophesied to you, ⸤saying⸥,\f + \fr 37:19 \ft Literally “to say” \f* ‘The king of Babylon will not come against you and against this land’? 
\v 20 Now then, my lord the king, please let my plea fall ⸤before you⸥.\f + \fr 37:20 \ft Literally “to the face of you” \f* You must not send me back \add to\add* the house of Jonathan the secretary, so that I will not die there.” 
\v 21 So King Zedekiah commanded, and they handed Jeremiah over in the courtyard of the guard, and they gave to him a round loaf of bread from the street of the bakers ⸤every day⸥\f + \fr 37:21 \ft Literally “for the day” \f* until the finishing of all the bread from the city. And Jeremiah stayed in the courtyard of the guard.

\s1 Jeremiah is Thrown into the Pit of Malchiah
\m 
\v 1 Now Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, and Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchiah heard the words that Jeremiah \add was\add* saying to all the people, ⸤saying⸥,\f + \fr 38:1 \ft Literally “to say” \f* 
\v 2 “Thus says Yahweh, ‘The \add one who\add* stays in this city will die by the sword, by the famine, and by the plague. But the \add one who\add* goes out to the Chaldeans will live. And his life will be for him as booty, and he will live.’ 
\v 3 Thus says Yahweh, ‘Surely this city will be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it.’ ”
\p 
\v 4 Then the officials said to the king, “Please, this man must be killed, ⸤because⸥\f + \fr 38:4 \ft Literally “unto thus” \f* he \add is\add* making slack the hands of ⸤the soldiers⸥\f + \fr 38:4 \ft Literally “the men of the war” \f* who are left in this city, and the hands of all the people, by speaking to them words like these, for this man \add is\add* not seeking for welfare\f + \fr 38:4 \ft Or “peace” \f* to this people, ⸤but only⸥\f + \fr 38:4 \ft Literally “but if” \f* for harm.” 
\v 5 And Zedekiah the king said, “Look, he \add is\add* in your hand, for the king is not able \add to do\add* a thing against you.” 
\v 6 So they took Jeremiah and threw him into the pit\f + \fr 38:6 \ft Or “cistern” \f* \add of\add* Malchiah, the son of the king, which \add was\add* in the courtyard of the guard. And they let Jeremiah down by ropes. Now in the pit\f + \fr 38:6 \ft Or “cistern” \f* there was no water,\f + \fr 38:6 \ft Hebrew “waters” \f* ⸤but only⸥\f + \fr 38:6 \ft Literally “but if” \f* mud, and Jeremiah sank in the mud.
\p 
\v 7 When Ebed-melech the Cushite, ⸤a eunuch⸥\f + \fr 38:7 \ft Literally “a man of a eunuch” \f* who \add was\add* in the house of the king, heard that they had put Jeremiah into the pit\f + \fr 38:7 \ft Or “cistern” \f*—now the king \add was\add* sitting at the Gate of Benjamin— 
\v 8 Ebed-melech went out from the house of the king and spoke to the king, ⸤saying⸥,\f + \fr 38:8 \ft Literally “to say” \f* 
\v 9 “My lord the king, these men have done evil \add in\add* all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, \add in\add* that they have thrown \add him\add* into the pit,\f + \fr 38:9 \ft Or “cistern” \f* and he will die ⸤there⸥\f + \fr 38:9 \ft Literally “in it” \f* ⸤because of⸥\f + \fr 38:9 \ft Literally “from the face of” \f* starvation, for there is no longer any bread in the city.” 
\v 10 Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Cushite, ⸤saying⸥,\f + \fr 38:10 \ft Literally “to say” \f* “Take ⸤with you⸥\f + \fr 38:10 \ft Literally “in your hand” \f* these thirty men and pull Jeremiah the prophet up from the pit\f + \fr 38:10 \ft Or “cistern” \f* ⸤before⸥\f + \fr 38:10 \ft Literally “at not yet” \f* he dies.”
\p 
\v 11 So Ebed-melech took the men ⸤with him⸥\f + \fr 38:11 \ft Literally “in his hand” \f* and went \add to\add* the palace of the king, to \add a place\add* beneath the storehouse, and he took from there ⸤rags⸥\f + \fr 38:11 \ft Literally “the rags of rags” \f* and ⸤worn-out clothes⸥.\f + \fr 38:11 \ft Literally “rags of ragged clothes” \f* And he let them down into the pit\f + \fr 38:11 \ft Or “cistern” \f* by ropes to Jeremiah. 
\v 12 Then Ebed-melech the Cushite said to Jeremiah, “Please put ⸤the rags⸥\f + \fr 38:12 \ft Literally “rags of the rags” \f* and ⸤worn-out clothes⸥\f + \fr 38:12 \ft Literally “ragged clothes” \f* under the joints of your arms under the ropes,” and Jeremiah did so. 
\v 13 And they pulled Jeremiah by the ropes and brought him up from the pit.\f + \fr 38:13 \ft Or “cistern” \f* And Jeremiah stayed in the courtyard of the guard.
\p 
\v 14 And Zedekiah the king sent and made someone bring Jeremiah the prophet to him, to \add the\add* third entrance that \add was\add* at the ⸤temple⸥\f + \fr 38:14 \ft Literally “house” \f* of Yahweh. And the king said to Jeremiah, “I \add am\add* asking you ⸤something⸥,\f + \fr 38:14 \ft Literally “a thing” \f* you must not hide ⸤anything⸥\f + \fr 38:14 \ft Literally “a thing” \f* from me.” 
\v 15 And Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I tell you, will you not surely kill me? ⸤Besides⸥,\f + \fr 38:15 \ft Literally “And” \f* if I advise you, you will not listen to me. 
\v 16 So Zedekiah the king swore to Jeremiah in secret, ⸤saying⸥,\f + \fr 38:16 \ft Literally “to say” \f* “⸤As Yahweh lives⸥,\f + \fr 38:16 \ft Literally “Life of Yahweh” \f* who has made for us this life, I will not kill you and I will not give you into the hand of these men who are seeking your life.”
\p 
\v 17 Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “Thus says Yahweh, the God of hosts, the God of Israel, ‘If only you will go surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then ⸤you⸥\f + \fr 38:17 \ft Literally “your life” or “your soul” \f* will live, and this city will not be burned with fire, and you will live, you and your house. 
\v 18 But if you \add do\add* not go surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then this city will be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they will burn it with fire, and you will not escape from their hand.’ ”
\p 
\v 19 And Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, “I \add am\add* afraid of the Judeans who have deserted to the Chaldeans, lest they give me into their hand and they abuse me.” 
\v 20 And Jeremiah said, “They will not give \add you over\add*. Please obey the voice of Yahweh with regard to what I \add am\add* saying to you, and it will go well with you, and ⸤you⸥\f + \fr 38:20 \ft Literally “your life” or “your soul” \f* will live. 
\v 21 But if you \add are\add* refusing to surrender, this \add is\add* the thing that Yahweh has shown me. 
\v 22 Now look, all the women who remain in the house of the king of Judah \add are\add* being led out to the officials of the king of Babylon. And look, \add they are\add* saying,

\p 
\v 23 And all your wives and your children \add will be\add* led out to the Chaldeans, and you will not escape from their hand, but by the hand of the king of Babylon you will be seized, and this city will burn with fire.”
\p 
\v 24 And Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “No man must know about these words so that you will not die. 
\v 25 And if the officials hear that I have spoken with you, and they come to you and say to you, ‘Please tell us what you said to the king. You must not conceal \add it\add* from us so that we will not kill you. And what did the king say to you?’

\v 27 And all the officials came to Jeremiah and questioned him, and he informed them like all these words that the king commanded. So they fell silent, for the ⸤conversation⸥\f + \fr 38:27 \ft Literally “word” \f* was not heard.

\s1 The Fall of Jerusalem
\m 
\v 1 In the ninth year of Zedekiah, the king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem and laid siege to it. 
\v 2 In the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, on \add the\add* ninth \add day\add* of the month, the city was taken by assault. 
\v 3 And all the officials of the king of Babylon came and sat in the Middle Gate: Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim \add the\add* chief officer, Nergal-sharezer \add the\add* high official, with all the rest of the officials of the king of Babylon. 
\v 4 ⸤And then⸥\f + \fr 39:4 \ft Literally “And it was” \f* ⸤when⸥\f + \fr 39:4 \ft Literally “as that” \f* Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them, and all ⸤the soldiers⸥\f + \fr 39:4 \ft Literally “the men of the war” \f* \add with him\add*, they fled and went out \add at\add* night from the city \add by\add* the way of the garden of the king through \add the\add* gate between the walls. And they went out toward the Jordan Valley. 
\v 5 But the army of \add the\add* Chaldeans pursued after them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. And they took him and brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon \add at\add* Riblah in the land of Hamath. And he pronounced ⸤sentence⸥\f + \fr 39:5 \ft Literally “judgments” \f* on him. 
\v 6 And the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah at Riblah before his eyes. The king of Babylon also slaughtered all the nobles of Judah. 
\v 7 Then he blinded the eyes of Zedekiah and tied him up with bronze fetters to bring him \add to\add* Babylon. 
\v 8 And the Chaldeans burned the palace\f + \fr 39:8 \ft Or “house” \f* of the king and the houses\f + \fr 39:8 \ft Hebrew “house” \f* of the people with fire and broke down the walls of Jerusalem.
\p 
\v 9 Then the rest of the people who were left in the city, and those deserting who had deserted to him, and the rest of the people who remained, Nebuzaradan, \add the\add* captain of \add the\add* guard,\f + \fr 39:9 \ft Hebrew “guards” \f* deported \add to\add* Babylon.

\p 
\v 11 And Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon commanded concerning Jeremiah ⸤through⸥\f + \fr 39:11 \ft Literally “in the hand of” \f* Nebuzaradan, \add the\add* captain of \add the\add* guard,\f + \fr 39:11 \ft Hebrew “guards” \f* ⸤saying⸥,\f + \fr 39:11 \ft Literally “to say” \f*

\s1 Jeremiah Decides to Remain in the Land
\m 
\v 1 The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh after Nebuzaradan, \add the\add* captain of \add the\add* guard,\f + \fr 40:1 \ft Hebrew “guards” \f* had let him go from Ramah, ⸤where he had been taken⸥\f + \fr 40:1 \ft Literally “at his taking him \f* bound in chains in the midst of all the exiles\f + \fr 40:1 \ft Hebrew “exile” \f* of Jerusalem and Judah who were being deported \add to\add* Babylon. 
\v 2 And \add the\add* captain of \add the\add* guard\f + \fr 40:2 \ft Hebrew “guards” \f* took Jeremiah and said to him, “Yahweh your God threatened this disaster to this place,

\v 6 So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, \add at\add* Mizpah and stayed with him in the midst of the people who were left in the land.
\s1 The Assassination of Gedaliah
\m 
\v 7 When all the commanders of the armies who \add were\add* in the open country and their men heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam \add in an official position\add* in the land, and that ⸤he had put him in charge of⸥\f + \fr 40:7 \ft Literally “he had appointed to him” \f* men, and women, and little children, and of the poor of the land, of \add all those\add* who had not been deported \add to\add* Babylon,

\v 16 But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, “You must not do this thing, for you \add are\add* telling a lie about Ishmael.”

\v 1  ⸤And then⸥\f + \fr 41:1 \ft Literally “And it was” \f* in the seventh month Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, from the offspring of the kingship, and \add one of\add* the chief officers of the king, came to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam \add at\add* Mizpah, ⸤along with⸥\f + \fr 41:1 \ft Literally “and” \f* ten men.

\v 2 And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah got up, ⸤along with⸥\f + \fr 41:2 \ft Literally “and” \f* the ten men who were with him, and they struck Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, with the sword and killed him whom the king of Babylon had appointed \add in an official position\add* over the land. 
\v 3 Then Ishmael killed all the Judeans who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah, ⸤along with⸥\f + \fr 41:3 \ft Literally “and” \f* the Chaldeans who were found there, ⸤the soldiers⸥.\f + \fr 41:3 \ft Literally “the men of the war” \f*

\v 4 ⸤And then⸥\f + \fr 41:4 \ft Literally “And it was” \f* on the second day of the killing of Gedaliah—and ⸤no one⸥\f + \fr 41:4 \ft Literally “not a man” \f* knew— 
\v 5 then men came from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, eighty men \add with\add* shaven beards\f + \fr 41:5 \ft Hebrew “beard” \f* and torn garments, \add who had\add* cut themselves with blades, ⸤having⸥\f + \fr 41:5 \ft Literally “and” \f* grain offerings\f + \fr 41:5 \ft Hebrew “grain offering” \f* and frankincense in their hands\f + \fr 41:5 \ft Hebrew “hand” \f* to bring \add to\add* the ⸤temple⸥\f + \fr 41:5 \ft Literally “house” \f* of Yahweh.

\v 7 ⸤And then⸥,\f + \fr 41:7 \ft Literally “And it was” \f* the moment of their coming to the middle of the city, then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, ⸤along with⸥\f + \fr 41:7 \ft Literally “and” \f* the men who \add were\add* with him, slaughtered\f + \fr 41:7 \ft The Hebrew verb is singular \f* them \add and threw them\add* to the middle of the pit.\f + \fr 41:7 \ft Or “cistern” \f* 
\v 8 But ten men were found among them, and they said to Ishmael, “You must not kill us, for ⸤we have⸥\f + \fr 41:8 \ft Literally “there is to us” \f* hidden treasures in the field, wheat, and barley, and oil, and honey.

\v 9 Now the pit\f + \fr 41:9 \ft Or “cistern” \f* \add into\add* which Ishmael threw all the corpses of the men whom he had killed ⸤along with⸥\f + \fr 41:9 \ft Literally “by the hand of” \f* Gedaliah \add was the same one\add* that King Asa had made because of Baasha the king of Israel, \add who was\add* against him. Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled \add it with\add* the slain ones.
\p 
\v 10 Then Ishmael took captive all the rest of the people who \add were\add* in Mizpah, the daughters of the king and all the people who were left at Mizpah, \add over\add* whom Nebuzaradan, \add the\add* captain of \add the\add* guard,\f + \fr 41:10 \ft Hebrew “guards” \f* had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.

\p 
\v 11 When Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies who \add were\add* with him, heard\f + \fr 41:11 \ft The Hebrew verb is singular \f* all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,

\v 1 Then all the commanders of the armies, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from \add the\add* smallest to \add the\add* greatest, approached

\v 7 ⸤And then⸥\f + \fr 42:7 \ft Literally “And it was” \f* at \add the\add* end of ten days the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah. 
\v 8 And he summoned Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the commanders of the armies who \add were\add* with him, and all the people from \add the\add* smallest to \add the\add* greatest, 
\v 9 and said to them, “Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to cause your plea to fall ⸤before him⸥:\f + \fr 42:9 \ft Literally “to the face of him” \f* 
\v 10 ‘If only you will stay in this land, then I will build you and I will not tear \add you\add* down, and I will plant you and I will not pluck \add you\add* up, for I relent of the disaster that I have brought to you.

\p 
\v 13 But if you \add are\add* saying, “We will not stay in this land,” \add so as to\add* not listen to the voice of Yahweh your God, 
\v 14 saying, “No, for we will go \add to\add* the land of Egypt where we will not see war, and we will not hear \add the\add* sound of a horn, and we will not be hungry for bread, and there we will stay,” 
\v 15 then ⸤therefore⸥\f + \fr 42:15 \ft Literally “to thus” \f* hear the word of Yahweh, O remnant of Judah.

\v 18 For thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: “As my anger and my wrath were poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so my wrath will pour out on you at your going \add to\add* Egypt, and you will become a curse, and a horror, and a curse \add formula\add*, and a disgrace, and you will no longer see this place.” ’
\p 
\v 19 Yahweh has spoken to you, O remnant of Judah, ‘You must not go \add to\add* Egypt.’ You must certainly know that I have warned you ⸤today⸥\f + \fr 42:19 \ft Literally “the day” \f*

\s1 A Message of Rebuke for the Rebellious Remnant
\m 
\v 1 The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Judeans who were living in the land of Egypt, who were living at Migdol, and Tahpanhes, and Memphis, and in the land of Pathros, ⸤saying⸥,\f + \fr 44:1 \ft Literally “to say” \f* 
\v 2 “Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘You yourselves have seen all the disaster that I have brought on Jerusalem, and on all the towns of Judah. And look, they \add are\add* a site of ruins this day, and there is not in them an inhabitant, 
\v 3 ⸤because of⸥\f + \fr 44:3 \ft Literally “from the face of” \f* their wickedness that they committed to provoke me to anger by going to make smoke offerings, serving other gods whom they had not known, \add neither\add* they, you, or your ancestors.\f + \fr 44:3 \ft Or “fathers” \f* 
\v 4 And I sent to you all my servants the prophets, ⸤sending over and over again⸥,\f + \fr 44:4 \ft Literally “doing early and sending” \f* ⸤saying⸥,\f + \fr 44:4 \ft Literally “to say” \f* “Please, you must not do this detestable thing that I hate.” 
\v 5 But they did not listen and they did not incline their ears\f + \fr 44:5 \ft Hebrew “ear” \f* to turn back from their wickedness, to not make smoke offerings to other gods. 
\v 6 So my wrath and my anger were poured out\f + \fr 44:6 \ft The Hebrew verb is singular \f* and burned\f + \fr 44:6 \ft The Hebrew verb is singular \f* in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, and they became as a site of ruins, as a desolation, as \add they are\add* this day.’
\p 
\v 7 So then, thus says Yahweh, the God of hosts, the God of Israel, ‘Why \add are\add* you doing great harm to ⸤yourselves⸥,\f + \fr 44:7 \ft Literally “your lives” \f* to cut off for yourselves man and woman, child and suckling, from the midst of Judah, to not leave over for yourselves a remnant, 
\v 8 provoking me to anger with the works of your hands, to make smoke offerings to other gods in the land of Egypt where you \add have\add* come to dwell as aliens, so as to cut off yourselves, and so that you are becoming as a curse, and as a disgrace among all the nations of the earth? 
\v 9 Have you forgotten the wicked things of your ancestors,\f + \fr 44:9 \ft Or “fathers” \f* and the wicked things of the kings of Judah, and the wicked things of their wives, and your wicked things, and the wicked things of your wives, which they committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? 
\v 10 They have not shown contrition up to this day, and they have not shown reverence, and they have not walked in my law and in my statutes that I set ⸤before you⸥\f + \fr 44:10 \ft Literally “to the face of you” \f* and ⸤before⸥\f + \fr 44:10 \ft Literally “to the face of” \f* your ancestors.’\f + \fr 44:10 \ft Or “fathers” \f*

\v 13 So I will punish those who live in the land of Egypt just as I have punished Jerusalem, with the sword, with the famine, and with the plague. 
\v 14 And there will not be a survivor or an escapee of the remnant of Judah, those who have come to dwell as an alien there in the land of Egypt, to return \add to\add* the land of Judah where they \add are\add* ⸤longing⸥\f + \fr 44:14 \ft Literally “lifting up their soul” \f* to return to dwell there, for they will not turn back, ⸤but only⸥\f + \fr 44:14 \ft Literally “but if” \f* \add some\add* survivors.’ ”

\p 
\v 24 Then Jeremiah said to all the people and to all the women, “Hear the word of Yahweh, all Judah who \add are\add* in the land of Egypt.

\q1 “Look, I \add am\add* going to stir up against Babylon

\q1 
\v 3 Let not him who bends the bow shoot his bow,

\q1 And you must not spare her young men;
\q2 destroy her whole army.
\q1 
\v 4 And they will fall slain in the land of \add the\add* Chaldeans,
\q2 and pierced through in her streets.
\q1 
\v 5 For neither Israel nor Judah \add is\add* a widower from their God,

\q1 
\v 6 Flee from the midst of Babylon and save each one his life.
\q2 You must not perish because of her guilt.
\q1 For this \add is the\add* time of vengeance for Yahweh,

\q1 
\v 7 Babylon \add was\add* a cup of gold in the hand of Yahweh,

\v 8 Suddenly Babylon has fallen and she is shattered.
\q2 Wail over her!

\q1 
\v 9 We tried to heal Babylon, and she was not healed.
\q2 Forsake her and let us go each one to his country,

\q1 
\v 10 Yahweh has brought forth our vindication.

\v 11 Sharpen the arrows, fill the quivers!
\q2 Yahweh has stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Medes.
\q1 Because his plan concerning Babylon \add is\add* to destroy it,

\q1 
\v 17 All humankind turns out to be stupid,
