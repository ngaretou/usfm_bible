\s1 Superscription
\m 
\v 1 The vision of Isaiah son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, \add and\add* Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
\s1 Rebellious Judah
\sd0
\q1 
\v 2 Hear, heavens,
\q2 and listen, earth,
\q3 for Yahweh has spoken:
\q1 “I reared children
\q2 and I brought \add them\add* up,
\q3 but they rebelled against me.
\q1 
\v 3 An ox knows its owner
\q2 and a donkey the manger of its master.
\q1 Israel does not know;
\q2 my people do not understand.
\q1 
\v 4 Ah, sinful nation,
\q2 a people heavy \add with\add* iniquity,
\q1 offspring of evildoers,
\q2 children who deal corruptly.
\q1 They have forsaken Yahweh;
\q2 they have despised the holy one of Israel.
\q3 They are estranged \add and gone\add* backward.
\q1 
\v 5 Why do you want to be beaten again?
\q2 You continue \add in\add* rebellion.
\q1 \add The\add* whole of \add the\add* head \add is\add* sick,
\q2 and \add the\add* whole of \add the\add* heart \add is\add* faint.
\q1 
\v 6 From the sole of the foot and up to \add the\add* head
\q2 there is no health in it;
\q1 bruise and sore and bleeding wound have not been cleansed,
\q2 and they have not been bound up
\q2 and not softened with the oil.
\q1 
\v 7 Your country \add is\add* desolate,
\q2 your cities \add are\add* burned \add with\add* fire;
\q1 \add As for\add* your land, aliens are devouring it in your presence,
\q2 and \add it is\add* desolate, like devastation \add by\add* foreigners.
\q1 
\v 8 And the daughter of Zion is left like a booth in a vineyard,
\q2 like a shelter in a cucumber field,
\q2 like a city that is besieged.\f + \fr 1:8 \ft Or “preserved” \f*
\q1 
\v 9 If Yahweh of hosts had not left us survivors,\f + \fr 1:9 \ft Hebrew “survivor” \f*
\q2 we would have been as few as Sodom,
\q2 we would have become like Gomorrah.
\q1 
\v 10 Hear the word of Yahweh, rulers of Sodom!
\q2 Listen \add to\add* the teaching of our God, people of Gomorrah!
\q1 
\v 11 What \add is the\add* abundance of your sacrifices to me? says Yahweh.
\q2 I have had enough \add of\add* burnt offerings of rams
\q3 and \add the\add* fat \add of\add* fattened animals
\q2 and I do not delight in \add the\add* blood of bulls
\q3 and ram-lambs and goats.
\q1 
\v 12 When you come to appear before me,
\q2 who asked for this from your hand:
\q2 you trampling my courts?
\q1 
\v 13 You must not ⸤continue⸥\f + \fr 1:13 \ft Literally “increase” or “add to” \f* to bring offerings\f + \fr 1:13 \ft Hebrew “offering” \f* of futility,
\q2 incense—it \add is\add* an abomination to me;
\q1 new moon and Sabbath, \add the\add* calling of a convocation—
\q2 I cannot endure iniquity with \add solemn\add* assembly.
\q1 
\v 14 Your new moons and your appointed festivals my soul hates;
\q2 they have become to me like \add a\add* burden,
\q2 I am not able to bear \add them\add*.
\q1 
\v 15 And when you stretch out your hands,
\q2 I will hide my eyes from you;
\q1 even though you make many prayers,\f + \fr 1:15 \ft Hebrew “prayer” \f*
\q2 I \add will\add* not be listening.
\q1 Your hands are full of blood. 
\v 16 Wash! Make yourselves clean!
\q2 Remove the evil of your doings from before my eyes!
\q1 Cease to do evil! 
\v 17 Learn to do good!
\q2 Seek justice! Rescue \add the\add* oppressed!
\q2 Defend \add the\add* orphan! Plead for \add the\add* widow!
\q1 
\v 18 “Come now, and let us argue,” says Yahweh.
\q2 “Even though your sins are like scarlet, they will be white like snow;
\q2 even though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool.
\q1 
\v 19 If you are willing and you are obedient,
\q2 you shall eat the good of the land.
\q1 
\v 20 But if you refuse and you rebel, you shall be devoured \add by the\add* sword.
\sd0
\p For the mouth of Yahweh has spoken.”
\s1 Purifying Jerusalem
\sd0
\q1 
\v 21 How has a faithful city become like a whore?
\q2 Full of justice, righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers.
\q1 
\v 22 Your silver has become \add as\add* dross;
\q2 Your wine \add is\add* diluted with waters.
\q1 
\v 23 Your princes \add are\add* rebels
\q2 and companions of thieves.
\q1 Every one loves a bribe
\q2 and runs after gifts.
\q1 They do not defend \add the\add* orphan
\q2 and \add the\add* legal dispute of \add the\add* widow does not come before them.
\q1 
\v 24 Therefore, the declaration of the Lord Yahweh of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel:
\q1 “Ah, I will be relieved of my enemies,
\q2 and I will avenge myself on my foes.
\q1 
\v 25 And I will turn my hand against you;
\q1 I will purify your dross like lye,
\q2 and I will remove all \add of\add* your tin.
\q1 
\v 26 And I will restore your judges, as at the first,
\q2 and your counselors, as at the beginning.
\q1 After this ⸤you will be called⸥\f + \fr 1:26 \ft Literally “it will be called for you” \f* the city of righteousness,
\q2 faithful city.
\q1 
\v 27 Zion will be redeemed by justice,
\q2 and those of her who repent, by righteousness.
\q1 
\v 28 But \add the\add* destruction \add of\add* rebels and sinners \add shall be\add* together,
\q2 and those who forsake Yahweh will perish.
\q1 
\v 29 For you\f + \fr 1:29 \ft Literally “they,” but a few manuscripts read “you,” which fits the context better \f* will be ashamed of \add the\add* oaks \add in\add* which you delighted,
\q2 and you will be disgraced because of the gardens that you have chosen.
\q1 
\v 30 For you shall be like an oak withering its leaves,
\q2 and like a garden where there is no water for her.
\q1 
\v 31 And the strong \add man\add* shall become like tinder,
\q2 and his work like a spark.
\q1 And both of them shall burn together,
\q2 and there is not one to quench \add them\add*.”

\c 2
\s1 The Mountain of Yahweh
\m 
\v 1 The word that Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem:
\sd0
\q1 
\v 2 And it shall happen in the future of the days
\q1 the mountain of the house\f + \fr 2:2 \ft Or “temple” \f* of Yahweh \add shall\add* be established;
\q1 it will be among the highest\f + \fr 2:2 \ft Literally “head” \f* of the mountains,
\q2 and it shall be raised from \add the\add* hills.
\q1 All \add of\add* the nations shall travel to him;
\q2 
\v 3 many peoples shall come.
\q1 And they shall say,
\q1 “Come, let us go up to the mountain of Yahweh,
\q2 to the house\f + \fr 2:3 \ft Or “temple” \f* of the God of Jacob,
\q1 and may he teach us part of his ways,
\q2 and let us walk in his paths.”
\q1 For instruction shall go out from Zion,
\q2 and the word of Yahweh from Jerusalem.
\q1 
\v 4 He shall judge between the nations
\q2 and he shall arbitrate for many peoples.
\q1 They shall beat their swords into ploughshares
\q2 and their spears into pruning hooks.
\q1 A nation shall not lift up a sword against a nation,
\q2 and they shall not learn war again.
\sd0
\s1 The Day of Yahweh
\sd0
\q1 
\v 5 House of Jacob, come and let us walk in the light of Yahweh.
\q1 
\v 6 For you have forsaken your people, house of Jacob,
\q1 because they are full\f + \fr 2:6 \ft Possibly “of diviners” was part of the original text here \f* from \add the\add* east,
\q2 and \add of\add* soothsayers like the Philistines,
\q2 and ⸤they make alliances⸥\f + \fr 2:6 \ft Literally “they clap \fq hands \ft ” \f* with the offspring of foreigners.
\q1 
\v 7 And its land is filled \add with\add* silver and gold,
\q2 and there is no end to its treasures;
\q1 and its land is filled \add with\add* horses,
\q2 and \add there is\add* no end to its chariots.
\q1 
\v 8 Its land is filled \add with\add* idols;
\q2 they bow down to the work of their\f + \fr 2:8 \ft Hebrew “his” \f* hands,
\q2 to what they made \add with\add* their\f + \fr 2:8 \ft Hebrew “his” \f* fingers.
\q1 
\v 9 So humanity is humbled;
\q2 everyone is humbled,
\q2 and you must not forgive them.
\q1 
\v 10 Enter into the rock
\q2 and hide yourself in the dust
\q1 from the presence of the terror of Yahweh
\q2 and from the glory of his majesty.
\q1 
\v 11 The ⸤haughty eyes⸥\f + \fr 2:11 \ft Literally “eyes of the haughtiness” \f* of humanity will\f + \fr 2:11 \ft The Hebrew is singular \f* be brought low,
\q2 and the pride of everyone will be humbled,
\q1 and Yahweh alone will be exalted on that day.
\q1 
\v 12 For \add there is\add* a day for Yahweh of hosts
\q2 against all of \add the\add* proud and \add the\add* lofty
\q2 and against all that is lifted up and humble,\f + \fr 2:12 \ft Or “it will be humbled” \f*
\q1 
\v 13 and against all the lofty and lifted up cedars of Lebanon,
\q2 and against all the large trees of Bashan,
\q1 
\v 14 and against all the high mountains,
\q2 and against all the lofty hills,
\q1 
\v 15 and against every kind of high tower,
\q2 and against every kind of fortified wall,
\q1 
\v 16 and against all the ships of Tarshish,
\q2 and against all the ships of desire.
\q1 
\v 17 And the haughtiness of the people shall be humbled,
\q2 and the pride of everyone shall be brought low,
\q1 and Yahweh alone will be exalted on that day.
\q1 
\v 18 And the idols shall pass away entirely,
\q1 
\v 19 and they will enter into \add the\add* caves of \add the\add* rocks
\q2 and into \add the\add* holes of \add the\add* ground
\q1 from the presence of the terror of Yahweh
\q2 and from the glory of his majesty
\q1 ⸤when he rises⸥\f + \fr 2:19 \ft Literally “in his rising” \f* to terrify the earth.
\q1 
\v 20 On that day humanity will throw away its idols of silver
\q2 and its idols of gold,
\q3 which they made for it to worship,
\q2 to the rodents\f + \fr 2:20 \ft Or “moles” \f* and to the bats—
\q1 
\v 21 to enter into the crevices of the rocks
\q2 and into the clefts of the crags
\q1 from the presence of the terror of Yahweh
\q2 and from the glory of his majesty,
\q1 ⸤when he rises⸥\f + \fr 2:21 \ft Literally “in his rising” \f* to terrify the earth.
\q1 
\v 22 Turn away from humanity,
\q2 who \add has\add* breath in its nostrils,\f + \fr 2:22 \ft Hebrew “nostril” \f*
\q1 for by\f + \fr 2:22 \ft Or “in” \f* what \add is\add* it esteemed?

\s1 Leaders of Judah and Jerusalem
\sd0
\q1 
\v 1 For look, the Lord Yahweh of hosts \add is\add* removing ⸤every source of support⸥\f + \fr 3:1 \ft Literally “supplies and supplies” \f*
\q2 from Jerusalem and from Judah:
\q1 all of \add the\add* supplies of bread
\q2 and all of \add the\add* supplies of water,
\q1 
\v 2 mighty warrior and man of war,
\q2 judge and prophet,
\q2 and diviner and elder,
\q1 
\v 3 captain of fifty and the honorable men of rank,
\q2 and counselor and skillful magicians and skillful enchanter.
\q1 
\v 4 And I will make boys their princes,
\q2 and children shall rule over them.
\q1 
\v 5 And the people will be oppressed ⸤by each other⸥\f + \fr 3:5 \ft Literally “man by man” \f*
\q2 and a man by his neighbor.
\q1 The boy will act arrogantly toward the elder,
\q2 and the dishonorable toward the honorable.
\q1 
\v 6 Indeed, a man will seize his brother
\q2 \add in\add* the house of his father:
\q1 “⸤You have a cloak⸥;\f + \fr 3:6 \ft Literally “a cloak for you” \f*
\q2 you shall be a leader for us,
\q2 and this heap of ruins \add shall be\add* under your hand!”
\q1 
\v 7 He will lift up \add his voice\add* on that day, saying,
\q1 “I will not be a healer;
\q2 in my house there is no bread
\q3 and there is no cloak.
\q2 You shall not make me \add the\add* leader of \add the\add* people!”
\q1 
\v 8 For Jerusalem has stumbled,
\q2 and Judah has fallen
\q1 because their speech and their deeds \add are\add* against Yahweh,
\q2 defying the eyes of his glory.
\q1 
\v 9 The look on their faces testifies against them
\q2 and they declare their sin like Sodom;
\q3 they do not hide \add it\add*.
\q1 Woe to their soul!
\q2 For they have dealt out evil to themselves.
\q1 
\v 10 Tell \add the\add* innocent\f + \fr 3:10 \ft Singular \f* that \add it is\add* good
\q2 for they shall eat the fruit of their deeds.
\q1 
\v 11 Woe to the wicked!\f + \fr 3:11 \ft Singular \f* \add It is\add* bad!
\q2 For what is done \add by\add* his hands will be done to him.
\q1 
\v 12 My people—children are their oppressors,
\q2 and women rule over them.
\q1 My people, your leaders are misleading \add you\add*,
\q2 and they confuse the course of your paths.
\q1 
\v 13 Yahweh takes his stand to conduct a legal case
\q2 and takes his stand to judge \add the\add* peoples.
\q1 
\v 14 Yahweh enters into judgment with the elders of his people and its princes.
\q1 “And you! You have devoured the vineyard;
\q2 the spoil of the poor \add is\add* in your houses!
\q1 
\v 15 ⸤Why⸥\f + \fr 3:15 \ft Literally “What to you” \f* do you crush my people
\q2 and grind \add the\add* face of \add the\add* poor?”
\sd0
\p ⸤declares⸥\f + \fr 3:15 \ft Literally “declaration of” \f* the Lord Yahweh of hosts.
\s1 The Pride of Jerusalem’s Women
\sd0
\q1 
\v 16 And Yahweh said: “Because\f + \fr 3:16 \ft There are two Hebrew words for “because” here \f* the daughters of Zion are haughty,
\q2 and they walk \add with\add* outstretched neck,
\q2 and they give flirting glances \add with their\add* eyes,
\q3 ⸤mincing along as they go⸥,\f + \fr 3:16 \ft Literally “they go walking and mincing along” \f*
\q2 and ⸤with their feet they rattle their bangles⸥,\f + \fr 3:16 \ft Literally “they tinkle with their feet” \f*
\q1 
\v 17 the Lord will make the heads\f + \fr 3:17 \ft Hebrew “head” \f* of the daughters of Zion scabby,
\q2 and Yahweh will lay their foreheads bare.”
\q1 
\v 18 In that day the Lord will take away the finery of the anklets
\q2 and the headbands and the crescent necklaces,
\q1 
\v 19 the pendants and the bracelets and the veils,
\q2 
\v 20 the headdresses and the armlets and the sashes,
\q1 and the ⸤perfume boxes⸥\f + \fr 3:20 \ft Literally “houses of \fq the \ft breath” \f* and the amulets,
\q2 
\v 21 the signet rings and the nose rings,
\q1 
\v 22 the festal robes and the mantles,
\q2 and the cloaks and the handbags,
\q1 
\v 23 and the mirrors and the linen garments,
\q2 and the turbans and the wraps.
\q1 
\v 24 And this shall happen: There will be
\q2 a stench instead of perfume,
\q1 and a rope instead of a sash,
\q2 and baldness instead of a well-set hairdo,
\q1 and a clothing wrap of sackcloth instead of a rich robe,
\q2 branding instead of beauty.
\q1 
\v 25 Your men shall fall by the sword,
\q2 and your warriors in battle.
\q1 
\v 26 And her\f + \fr 3:26 \ft That is, Jerusalem’s \f* gates shall lament and mourn,
\q2 and she shall be banished;
\q3 she shall sit upon the ground.
\sd0
\c 4
\sd0
\q1 
\v 1  And seven women shall grasp at one man on that day, saying,
\q1 “We will eat our own bread,
\q2 and we will wear our own clothing;
\q1 only ⸤let us be called by your name⸥!\f + \fr 4:1 \ft Literally “let your name be called upon us” \f*
\q2 Take away our disgrace!”
\sd0
\s1 The Glory of the Branch of Yahweh
\sd0
\q1 
\v 2 On that day the branch of Yahweh shall become beautiful and glorious,
\q2 and the fruit of the land \add shall become the\add* pride and glory of the survivors\f + \fr 4:2 \ft Hebrew “survivor” \f* of Israel.
\q1 
\v 3 And this shall happen: He who is left in Zion
\q2 and he who remains in Jerusalem will be called holy,
\q3 everyone written for life in Jerusalem,
\q1 
\v 4 when the Lord has washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion
\q2 and cleansed the blood of Jerusalem from her midst
\q1 by a spirit of judgment
\q2 and by a spirit of burning.
\q1 
\v 5 Then Yahweh will create over all of the site\f + \fr 4:5 \ft Or “place” \f* of ⸤Mount Zion⸥\f + \fr 4:5 \ft Literally “the mountain of Zion” \f*
\q2 and over her assembly a cloud by day
\q2 and smoke and the brightness of flaming fire \add by\add* night.
\q1 Indeed, over all \add the\add* glory \add there will be\add* a canopy,
\q2 
\v 6 and it will be a shelter for shade from \add the\add* heat by day,
\q2 and a refuge and a hiding place from rainstorm and from rain.

\s1 The Song of the Vineyard
\sd0
\q1 
\v 1 Let me sing for my beloved
\q2 a song of my love concerning his vineyard:
\q1 ⸤My beloved had a vineyard⸥\f + \fr 5:1 \ft Literally “A vineyard was for my beloved” \f* on ⸤a fertile hill⸥.\f + \fr 5:1 \ft Literally “a horn of a son of olive oil.” The Hebrew for horn, \fqa qeren \ft , sounds like the Hebrew for vineyard, \fqa kerem \ft  \f*
\q1 
\v 2 And he dug it and cleared it of stones,
\q2 and he planted it \add with\add* choice vines,\f + \fr 5:2 \ft Hebrew “vine” \f*
\q1 and he built a watchtower in the middle of it,
\q2 and he even hewed out a wine vat in it,
\q1 and he waited for \add it\add* to yield grapes—
\q2 but it yielded wild grapes.
\q1 
\v 3 And now, inhabitants of Jerusalem
\q2 and men\f + \fr 5:3 \ft Hebrew “man” \f* of Judah, judge between me and my vineyard.
\q1 
\v 4 What more \add was there\add* to do for my vineyard that I have not done in it?
\q2 Why did I hope for \add it\add* to yield grapes, and it yielded wild grapes?
\sd0
\p 
\v 5 And now let me tell you what I myself am about to do to my vineyard.
\sd0
\q1 \add I will\add* remove its hedge, and it shall become a devastation.
\q2 \add I will\add* break down its wall, and it shall become a trampling.
\q1 
\v 6 And I will make it a wasteland;

\q1 and it shall be overgrown \add with\add* briers\f + \fr 5:6 \ft Hebrew “brier” \f* and thornbushes.\f + \fr 5:6 \ft Hebrew “thornbush” \f*
\q2 And concerning the clouds, I will command ⸤them not to send⸥\f + \fr 5:6 \ft Literally “from sending” \f* rain down upon it.

\q1 \add And\add* he waited for justice,\f + \fr 5:7 \ft The Hebrew word, \fqa mishpat, \ft sounds like \fqa mishpakh \ft in the next line \f*
\q2 but look! Bloodshed!\f + \fr 5:7 \ft The Hebrew word, \fqa mishpakh \ft , sounds like \fqa mishpat \ft in the previous line \f*
\q1 For righteousness,\f + \fr 5:7 \ft The Hebrew word, \fqa tsedaqah, \ft sounds like \fqa tsa`aqah \ft in the next line \f*

\s1 Woes on the Wicked

\q1 
\v 8 Ah! Those who ⸤join⸥\f + \fr 5:8 \ft Literally “touch” \f* house with house,

\q2 and you are caused to dwell alone in the midst of the land.
\sd0
\p 
\v 9 Yahweh of hosts \add said\add* in my ears:
\sd0
\q1 ⸤Surely⸥\f + \fr 5:9 \ft Literally “If not” \f* many houses shall become a desolation,
\q2 large and beautiful \add ones\add* without inhabitant.
\q1 
\v 10 For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath,\f + \fr 5:10 \ft A bath is a liquid measure \f*
\q1 and \add the\add* seed of a homer will yield an ephah.\f + \fr 5:10 \ft An ephah is a dry measure equal to one-tenth of a homer \f*
\q1 
\v 11 Ah! Those who rise early in the morning,
\q2 they pursue strong drink.

\q2 wine inflames them.
\q1 
\v 12 And \add there\add* will be lyre and harp,

\q1 
\v 14 Therefore Sheol has enlarged its throat,

\q1 
\v 15 And humankind is bowed down,
\q2 and man is brought low,
\q2 and \add the\add* eyes of \add the\add* haughty are humiliated.
\q1 
\v 16 But Yahweh of hosts is exalted by justice,

\q3 so that we may see it
\q1 and let it draw near

\q3 so that we may know \add it\add*!”
\q1 
\v 20 Ah! Those who call evil good and good evil,

\s1 The Sign to Ahaz

\v 12 But Ahaz said, “I will not ask, and I will not put Yahweh to the test.”

\v 13 Then he said, “Hear, house of David! \add Is it\add* too little for you to make men weary, that you should also make my God weary?

\s1 Sennacherib Threatens Jerusalem
\m 
\v 1 And this happened: In ⸤the fourteenth year⸥\f + \fr 36:1 \ft Literally “four ten year” \f* of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria went up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and he captured them. 
\v 2 And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh\f + \fr 36:2 \ft Rabshekah is the title of a high Assyrian official \f* from Lachish to Jerusalem, to King Hezekiah, with a large army, and he stood by the conduit of the upper pool on \add the\add* highway of \add the\add* field of \add the\add* washer. 
\v 3 And Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who ⸤was in charge of the palace⸥,\f + \fr 36:3 \ft Literally “\fq was \ft over the house” \f* came out to him, and Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph, the reminder.
\p 
\v 4 And Rabshakeh said to them, “Now say to Hezekiah, ‘Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: “What \add is\add* this confidence \add in\add* which you trust? 
\v 5 I said, ‘Only a word of lips! ⸤War has power and a plan⸥!’\f + \fr 36:5 \ft The Hebrew here is awkward; literally “Plan and power for war” \f* Now, in whom do you trust, that you have rebelled against me? 
\v 6 Look, you trust in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt, which \add if\add* a man leans on it, goes into his hand and bores through it! Such \add is\add* Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to all those who trust in him. 
\v 7 And if you say to me, ‘We trust in Yahweh our God,’ \add was it\add* not he whose high places and altars Hezekiah removed? And he said to Judah and to Jerusalem, ‘You shall bow down in the ⸤presence⸥\f + \fr 36:7 \ft Literally “face” \f* of this altar.’ ” 
\v 8 And now please make a wager with my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, \add that is,\add* if you are able ⸤put⸥\f + \fr 36:8 \ft Literally “give” \f* riders for yourself on them! 
\v 9 But how can you drive back ⸤one governor among the least of my master’s servants⸥,\f + \fr 36:9 \ft Literally “the face of the governor of the one of the insignificant servants of my master” \f* when\f + \fr 36:9 \ft Or “and” \f* you trust in Egypt for chariots\f + \fr 36:9 \ft Hebrew “chariot” \f* and horsemen? 
\v 10 And now was it without Yahweh that I have come up against this land to destroy it? Yahweh said to me, “Go up against this land and destroy it!” ’ ”
\p 
\v 11 And Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to Rabshakeh, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we can understand\f + \fr 36:11 \ft Or “hear” \f* \add it\add*, and you must not speak to us in Judean in the ⸤hearing⸥\f + \fr 36:11 \ft Literally “ear” \f* of the people who \add are\add* on the wall.”
\p 
\v 12 But\f + \fr 36:12 \ft Or “And” \f* Rabshakeh said, “Has my master sent me to speak these words to your masters and you? \add Was it\add* not for the people who sit on the wall, to eat their dung and drink their urine\f + \fr 36:12 \ft So Masoretic Hebrew text (\fqa Kethib \ft ); the reading tradition (\fqa Qere \ft ) has “feet-water” \f* with you?”
\p 
\v 13 Then\f + \fr 36:13 \ft Or “And” \f* Rabshakeh stood and called in a great voice in Judean and said, “Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria. 
\v 14 Thus says the king: ‘\add Do\add* not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you! 
\v 15 And \add do\add* not let Hezekiah make you rely on Yahweh, saying, “Surely Yahweh will deliver us; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria!” 
\v 16 You must not listen to Hezekiah, for thus says the king of Assyria: “Make a blessing\f + \fr 36:16 \ft That is, a gesture of surrender \f* with me, and come out to me, and each one will eat \add from\add* his vine and \add from\add* his fig tree and drink water from\f + \fr 36:16 \ft Or “of” \f* his cistern,

\p 
\v 21 But\f + \fr 36:21 \ft Or “And” \f* they were silent and did not answer him a word, for the command of the king was, “You must not answer him.” 
\v 22 Then\f + \fr 36:22 \ft Or “And” \f* Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who \add was\add* over the ⸤palace⸥,\f + \fr 36:22 \ft Literally “house” \f* Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph, the reminder, came to Hezekiah \add with\add* torn garments and told him the words of Rabshakeh.

\s1 Hezekiah Consults Isaiah
\m 
\v 1 And this happened: When King Hezekiah heard, he tore his garments, covered himself with sackcloth, and entered the temple\f + \fr 37:1 \ft Or “house” \f* of Yahweh. 
\v 2 And he sent Eliakim, who \add was\add* ⸤in charge of⸥\f + \fr 37:2 \ft Literally “over” \f* the palace,\f + \fr 37:2 \ft Or “house” \f* and Shebna the secretary, and the elders of the priests ⸤covered⸥\f + \fr 37:2 \ft Literally “covering themselves” \f* with sackcloth to Isaiah son of Amoz, the prophet. 
\v 3 And they said to him, “Thus says Hezekiah: ‘This day \add is\add* a day of distress, rebuke, and disgrace, for children have come to \add the\add* cervical opening, and there is no strength to give birth. 
\v 4 Maybe Yahweh your God heard \add the\add* words of Rabshakeh whom the king of Assyria, his master, has sent to taunt \add the\add* living God, and he will rebuke the words that Yahweh your God hears. And you must lift up a prayer for the benefit of the remnant that is found.’ ”
\p 
\v 5 When\f + \fr 37:5 \ft Or “And” \f* the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah, 
\v 6 Isaiah said to them, “You must say this to your master: ‘Thus says Yahweh: “You must not be afraid because of the words that you have heard, \add with\add* which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.

\p 
\v 8 And Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah, for he had heard that he had left from Lachish. 
\v 9 Now\f + \fr 37:9 \ft Or “And” \f* he\f + \fr 37:9 \ft That is, the king \f* heard concerning Tirhakah the king of Cush, saying, “He has set out to fight against\f + \fr 37:9 \ft Or “with” \f* you.”
\p When\f + \fr 37:9 \ft Or “And” \f* he heard \add it\add*, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,

\v 11 Look! you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands to destroy them, and you—shall you be delivered? 
\v 12 Did the gods of the nations that my ⸤predecessors⸥\f + \fr 37:12 \ft Literally “fathers” \f* destroyed deliver them—Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the sons of Eden who \add were\add* in Telassar?

\s1 Hezekiah’s Prayer

\v 14 And Hezekiah took the letter from the hand of the messengers, and he read\f + \fr 37:14 \ft Or “called” \f* it. Then\f + \fr 37:14 \ft Or “And” \f* he went up \add to\add* the temple\f + \fr 37:14 \ft Or “house” \f* of Yahweh, and Hezekiah spread it out before the ⸤presence⸥\f + \fr 37:14 \ft Literally “face” \f* of Yahweh. 
\v 15 And Hezekiah prayed to Yahweh, saying, 
\v 16 “Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel ⸤who is enthroned on⸥\f + \fr 37:16 \ft Literally “sitting” \f* the cherubim, you \add are\add* the one, God by yourself, of all the kingdoms of the earth; you are the one who made the heavens and the earth. 
\v 17 Yahweh, extend your ear and hear! Yahweh, open your eyes and see, and hear all the words of Sennacherib that he has sent to taunt the living God!

\s1 God’s Answer

\v 21 And Isaiah son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, “Thus says Yahweh the God of Israel: ‘Because you have prayed to me ⸤concerning⸥\f + \fr 37:21 \ft Literally “to” \f* Sennacherib, king of Assyria,

\s1 Proper Worship
\m 
\v 1 Thus says Yahweh:
\sd0
\q1 “Heaven \add is\add* my throne,
\q2 and the earth \add is\add* the footstool for my feet.
\q1 Where \add is\add* this house that you would build for me?
\q2 And where \add is\add* this resting place for me?
\q1 
\v 2 And my hand has made all these \add things\add*,
\q2 and all these ⸤came to be⸥,”\f + \fr 66:2 \ft Literally “were” \f*
\sd0
\p ⸤declares⸥\f + \fr 66:2 \ft Literally “declaration of” \f* Yahweh, “but\f + \fr 66:2 \ft Or “and” \f* I look to this \add one\add*:
\sd0
\q1 to \add the\add* humble and \add the\add* contrite of spirit
\q2 and \add the one\add* frightened at my word.
\q1 
\v 3 The one who slaughters \add a\add* bull strikes a man;
\q2 the one who slaughters \add a\add* lamb for sacrifice breaks the neck \add of\add* a dog.
\q1 The one who offers an offering, \add the\add* blood of swine;
\q2 the one who offers frankincense blesses an idol.
\q1 Indeed, they themselves have chosen their ways,
\q2 and their soul delights in their abhorrence.
\q1 
\v 4 Indeed, I myself I will choose their ill treatment,
\q2 and I will bring them objects of their dread,
\q1 because I called, and ⸤no one answered⸥;\f + \fr 66:4 \ft Literally “there was no one who answers” \f*
\q2 I spoke and they did not listen,
\q1 but\f + \fr 66:4 \ft Or “and” \f* they did the evil in my eyes,
\q2 and they chose that in which I do not delight.”
\sd0
\p 
\v 5 Hear the word of Yahweh, you who are frightened at his word:
\sd0
\q1 Your brothers who hate you,
\q2 who exclude you for my name’s sake have said,
\q1 “Let Yahweh be honored so that\f + \fr 66:5 \ft Or “and” \f* we may see your joy!”
\q2 But\f + \fr 66:5 \ft Or “And” \f* they themselves shall be ashamed.
\q1 
\v 6 A voice, an uproar from \add the\add* city!
\q2 A voice from \add the\add* temple!
\q3 The voice of Yahweh ⸤paying back⸥\f + \fr 66:6 \ft Literally “rewarding retribution to” \f* his enemies!

\s1 Zion’s Delivery
\sd0
\q1 
\v 7 Before she was in labor she gave birth;
\q2 before labor pains\f + \fr 66:7 \ft Hebrew “pain” \f* came to her, she gave birth to a son.
\q1 
\v 8 Who has heard \add anything\add* like this?
\q2 Who has seen \add anything\add* like these \add things\add*?
\q1 Can a land be born in one day?
\q2 Or can a nation be born in a moment?
\sd0
\p \add Yet\add* when she was in labor, Zion indeed gave birth \add to\add* her children.
\sd0
\q1 
\v 9 Shall I myself I break open and not ⸤deliver⸥?”\f + \fr 66:9 \ft Literally “cause to bring forth” \f* says Yahweh,
\q1 “or I who ⸤delivers⸥\f + \fr 66:9 \ft Literally “causes to bring forth” \f* lock up \add the womb\add*?” says your God.
\q1 
\v 10 “Rejoice with Jerusalem
\q2 and shout in exultation with her, all those who love her!
\q2 Rejoice with her \add in\add* joy, all those who mourn over her,
\q1 
\v 11 so that you may suck and be satisfied from her ⸤consoling breast⸥,\f + \fr 66:11 \ft Literally “breast of consolation” \f*
\q2 so that you may drink deeply and refresh yourselves from her ⸤heavy breast⸥.”\f + \fr 66:11 \ft Literally “breast of heaviness “ \f*
\sd0
\p 
\v 12 For thus says Yahweh:
\sd0
\q1 “Look! I \add am\add* about to spread prosperity out to her like a river,
\q2 and \add the\add* wealth of \add the\add* nations like an overflowing stream,
\q1 and you shall suck and be carried on the hip;
\q2 and you shall you shall be played with on the knees.
\q1 
\v 13 As a man whose mother comforts him, so I myself will comfort you,
\q2 and you shall be comforted in Jerusalem.

\q1

\q1 
\v 18 “And I—their works and thoughts!—\add am\add* about to come to gather all nations and tongues,
\q2 and they shall come and see my glory.
\q1 
\v 19 And I will set a sign among them,
\q2 and I will send survivors from them to the nations:
\q1 Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, who draw \add the\add* bow;
\q2 Tubal and Javan, the faraway coastlands

\q2 and have not seen my glory.

\p And they shall declare my glory among the nations,

\v 22 “For just as the new heavens and earth that I \add am\add* about to make shall stand before me,” ⸤declares⸥\f + \fr 66:22 \ft Literally “declaration of” \f* Yahweh, “so shall your descendants\f + \fr 66:22 \ft Hebrew “descendant” \f* and your name stand.

\v 23 And this shall happen: From ⸤new moon to new moon⸥\f + \fr 66:23 \ft Literally “enough of new moon in his new moon” \f* and from ⸤Sabbath to Sabbath⸥\f + \fr 66:23 \ft Literally “enough of Sabbath in his Sabbath” \f* all flesh shall come to bow in worship before me,” says Yahweh. 
\v 24 “And they shall go out and look at the corpses of the people\f + \fr 66:24 \ft Or “men” \f* ⸤who have rebelled⸥\f + \fr 66:24 \ft Literally “rebelling” \f* against me,
