\v 14 All these were busily engaged with one mind in prayer, together with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus and with\f + \fr 1:14 \ft Some manuscripts omit “with” \f* his brothers.

\v 17 because he was counted among us and received a share in this ministry.” 
\v 18 (Now this man acquired a field for the wages of \add his\add* wickedness, and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his intestines spilled out. 
\v 19 And it became known to all who live in Jerusalem, so that that field was called in their own language\f + \fr 1:19 \ft That is, Aramaic \f* “Akeldama,” that is, “Field of Blood.”)

\v 23 And they proposed two \add men\add*, Joseph called Barsabbas (who was called Justus) and Matthias. 
\v 24 And they prayed \add and\add*\ef + \fr 1:24 \ft ﻿*Here “\add and\add*” is supplied because the previous participle (“prayed”) has been translated as a finite verb \ef* said, “You, Lord, who know the hearts of all, show clearly which one of these two you have chosen

\v 2 And suddenly a sound like a violent rushing wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting. 
\v 3 And divided\f + \fr 2:3 \ft Or perhaps “distributed” \f* tongues like fire appeared to them and rested on each one of them.

\v 8 And how do we hear, each one \add of us\add*, in ⸤our own native language⸥?\f + \fr 2:8 \ft Literally “our own language in which we were born” \f* 
\v 9 Parthians and Medes and Elamites and those residing \add in\add* Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,\f + \fr 2:9 \ft A reference to the Roman province of Asia (modern Asia Minor) \f* 
\v 10 Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya toward Cyrene, and the Romans who were in town, 
\v 11 both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabs—we hear them speaking in our \add own\add* languages the great deeds of God!” 
\v 12 And all were amazed and greatly perplexed, saying ⸤to one another⸥,\f + \fr 2:12 \ft Literally “one to the other” \f* “⸤What can this mean?⸥”\f + \fr 2:12 \ft Literally “what does this want to be” \f*

\s1 Peter’s Sermon on the Day of Pentecost
\m 
\v 14 But Peter, standing with the eleven, raised his voice and declared to them, “Judean men, and all those who live \add in\add* Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and pay attention to my words! 
\v 15 For these \add men\add* are not drunk, as you assume, because it is the third hour of the day. 
\v 16 But this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel:
\sd0
\q1 
\v 17 ‘And it will be in the last days,’ God says,
\q2 ‘I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh,
\q3 and your sons and your daughters will prophesy,
\q3 and your young men will see visions,
\q3 and your old men will dream dreams.
\q1 
\v 18 And even on my male slaves and on my female slaves
\q2 I will pour out my Spirit in those days, and they will prophesy.
\q1 
\v 19 And I will cause wonders in the heaven\f + \fr 2:19 \ft Or “sky” \f* above
\q2 and signs on the earth below,

\v 20 The sun will be changed to darkness
\q2 and the moon to blood,
\q2 before the great and glorious day of the Lord comes.
\q1 
\v 21 And it will be \add that\add* everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved.’\f + \fr 2:21 \ft A quotation from \xt Joel 2:28–32 \ft \f*
\sd0
\p 
\v 22 “Israelite men, listen to these words! Jesus the Nazarene, a man attested to you by God with deeds of power and wonders and signs that God did through him in your midst, just as \add you\add* yourselves know—

\v 24 God raised ⸤him⸥\f + \fr 2:24 \ft Literally “whom”; it is necessary to specify “him” in the translation to avoid confusion with the “lawless men” in the previous verse \f* up, having brought to an end the pains of death, because it was not possible \add for\add* him to be held by it. 
\v 25 For David says with reference to him,
\sd0
\q1 ‘I saw the Lord before me ⸤continually⸥,\f + \fr 2:25 \ft Literally “through everything” \f*
\q2 for he is at my right hand so that I will not be shaken.
\q1 
\v 26 For this \add reason\add* my heart was glad
\q2 and my tongue rejoiced greatly,
\q2 furthermore also my flesh will live in hope,
\q1 
\v 27 because you will not abandon my soul in Hades,
\q2 nor will you permit your Holy One to experience decay.
\q1 
\v 28 You have made known to me the paths of life;
\q2 you will fill me with gladness with your presence.’\f + \fr 2:28 \ft A quotation from \xt Ps 16:8–11 \ft \f*
\sd0
\p 
\v 29 “Men \add and\add* brothers, it is possible to speak with confidence to you about the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us until this day.

\v 33 Therefore, having been exalted to the right hand of God and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, he has poured out this that you see and hear.\f + \fr 2:33 \ft Some manuscripts have “both see and hear” \f* 
\v 34 For David did not ascend into heaven, but he himself says,
\sd0
\q1 ‘The Lord said to my Lord,
\q1 “Sit at my right hand,
\q1 
\v 35 until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.” ’\f + \fr 2:35 \ft A quotation from \xt Ps 110:1 \ft \f*

\v 36 Therefore let all the house of Israel know beyond a doubt, that God has made him both Lord and Christ—this Jesus whom you crucified!”

\v 40 And with many other words he solemnly urged and exhorted them, saying, “Be saved from this crooked generation!” 
\v 41 So those who accepted his message were baptized, and on that day about three thousand souls were added.
\s1 The Fellowship of the First Believers
\m 
\v 42 And they were devoting themselves to the teaching of the apostles and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayers. 
\v 43 And fear came on every soul, and many wonders and signs were being performed by the apostles.

\v 2 And \add after\add*\ef + \fr 15:2 \ft ﻿*Here “\add after\add*” is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle (“was”) \ef* there was no little strife and debate by Paul and Barnabas against them, they appointed Paul and Barnabas and some others from among them to go up to the apostles and elders in Jerusalem concerning this issue.

\p 
\v 6 Both the apostles and the elders assembled to deliberate concerning this matter. 
\v 7 And \add after\add*\ef + \fr 15:7 \ft ﻿*Here “\add after\add*” is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle (“was”) \ef* there was much debate, Peter stood up \add and\add*\ef + \fr 15:7 \ft ﻿*Here “\add and\add*” is supplied because the previous participle (“stood up”) has been translated as a finite verb \ef* said to them, “Men \add and\add* brothers, you know that in the early days\f + \fr 15:7 \ft Or “from ancient days” \f* God chose among you through my mouth \add that\add* the Gentiles should hear the message of the gospel and believe.

\v 12 And the whole group became silent and listened to Barnabas and Paul describing all the signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them. 
\v 13 And after they had stopped speaking, James answered, saying, “Men \add and\add* brothers, listen to me! 
\v 14 Simeon has described how God first concerned himself to take from among the Gentiles a people for his name. 
\v 15 And with this the words of the prophets agree, just as it is written:
\sd0
\q1 
\v 16 ‘After these \add things\add* I will return
\q2 and build up again the tent of David that has fallen,
\q2 and the \add parts\add* of it that had been torn down I will build up again
\q2 and will restore it,
\q1 
\v 17 so that the rest of humanity may seek the Lord,
\q2 even all the Gentiles\f + \fr 15:17 \ft The same Greek word can be translated “nations” or “Gentiles” depending on the context \f* ⸤who are called by my name⸥,\f + \fr 15:17 \ft Literally “on whom my name has been called on them” \f*

\sd0
\p 
\v 19 Therefore I conclude we should not cause difficulty for those from among the Gentiles who turn to God, 
\v 20 but we should write a letter to them to abstain from the pollution of idols and from sexual immorality and from what has been strangled and from blood. 
\v 21 For Moses has those who proclaim him in every city from ancient generations, \add because he\add*\ef + \fr 15:21 \ft ﻿*Here “\add because\add*” is supplied as a component of the participle (“is read aloud”) which is understood as causal \ef* is read aloud in the synagogues on every Sabbath.”

\v 27 Therefore we have sent Judas and Silas, and they will report the same \add things\add* by word of mouth. 
\v 28 For it seemed best to the Holy Spirit and to us to place on you no greater burden except these necessary things:

\v 38 but Paul held the opinion they should not take this one along, who departed from them in Pamphylia and did not accompany them in the work.
