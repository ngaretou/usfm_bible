\s1 Daniel’s Development in the King’s Court
\m 
\v 1 In \add the\add* third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it. 
\v 2 And the Lord gave Jehoiakim the king of Judah into his hand and ⸤some of⸥\f + \fr 1:2 \ft Literally “from the end/extremity/limits” \f* of the utensils of the temple of God,\f + \fr 1:2 \ft Hebrew “the God” \f* and he brought them \add to\add* the land of Shinar \add to\add* the temple of his gods, and he brought the utensils to ⸤the treasury⸥\f + \fr 1:2 \ft Literally “the house of the treasury” \f* of his gods.
\p 
\v 3 And the king ⸤ordered⸥\f + \fr 1:3 \ft Literally “said to” \f* Ashpenaz, the commander of his court officials, to bring ⸤some of the Israelites⸥\f + \fr 1:3 \ft Literally “from the sons/children of Israel” \f* from ⸤the royal family⸥\f + \fr 1:3 \ft Literally “from the seed of the kingship” \f* and from the lords,\f + \fr 1:3 \ft Or “nobles” \f* 
\v 4 youths who ⸤have no physical defect⸥,\f + \fr 1:4 \ft Literally “there is not in them any physical defect” \f* and \add who are\add* ⸤handsome⸥,\f + \fr 1:4 \ft Literally “good/pleasing of appearance” \f* and \add who are\add* prudent\f + \fr 1:4 \ft Or “insightful” \f* in all wisdom and ⸤endowed with knowledge⸥,\f + \fr 1:4 \ft Literally “\fq who have \ft knowledge of knowledge” \f* and \add who\add* understand insight, and who \add have\add* the ⸤ability⸥\f + \fr 1:4 \ft Literally “strength” \f* in them to serve in the palace of the king. \add And the king ordered him\add* to teach them the literature and the language of \add the\add* Chaldeans. 
\v 5 And the king assigned to them ⸤his daily portion⸥\f + \fr 1:5 \ft Literally “\fq the \ft portion of the day on its day” \f* from the fine food of the king, and from ⸤the wine that he drank⸥,\f + \fr 1:5 \ft Literally “the wine of his drink” \f* and \add instructed that\add* ⸤they were to be educated for three years⸥.\f + \fr 1:5 \ft Literally “and to be educated them years three” \f* And at the end \add of\add* their \add training\add*, ⸤they were to be stationed⸥\f + \fr 1:5 \ft Literally “they would stand” \f* ⸤before⸥\f + \fr 1:5 \ft Literally “to the face of” \f* the king. 
\v 6 Now there was among them ⸤from the Judeans⸥,\f + \fr 1:6 \ft Literally “from the children of Judah” \f* Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah. 
\v 7 And the commander of the court officials gave them names, and he called Daniel, Belteshazzar; and Hananiah, Shadrach; and Mishael, Meshach; and Azariah, Abednego.
\s1 Daniel’s Resolve
\m 
\v 8 Now ⸤Daniel resolved⸥\f + \fr 1:8 \ft Literally “Daniel placed upon his heart” \f* that he would not defile himself with the fine food of the king, and with ⸤the wine that he drank⸥,\f + \fr 1:8 \ft Literally “the wine of his drink” \f* and \add so\add* he requested from the commander of the court officials \add permission so\add* that he would not defile himself. 
\v 9 And God\f + \fr 1:9 \ft Hebrew “the God” \f* gave Daniel favor and compassion ⸤before⸥\f + \fr 1:9 \ft Literally “to the face of” \f* the commander of the court officials, 
\v 10 and the commander of the court officials said to Daniel, “I \add am\add* afraid \add of\add* my lord, the king, who has determined your food and your drink, for ⸤why should⸥\f + \fr 1:10 \ft Literally “to what would” \f* he see your face having a worse appearance than the young men who ⸤are your age⸥?\f + \fr 1:10 \ft Literally “like your age”; “your” is plural \f* Then you will endanger my head with the king.” 
\v 11 Then\f + \fr 1:11 \ft Hebrew “And” \f* Daniel asked the guard\f + \fr 1:11 \ft Or “overseer” \f* whom the commander of the court officials \add had\add* appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, 
\v 12 “Please test your servants \add for\add* ten days, and let them give us ⸤some of the vegetables⸥,\f + \fr 1:12 \ft Literally “from the vegetables” \f* and let us eat and let us drink water. 
\v 13 Then\f + \fr 1:13 \ft Hebrew “And” \f* let our appearances and the appearance of the young men who are eating the fine food of the king be compared ⸤before you⸥,\f + \fr 1:13 \ft Literally “in your presence” \f* and \add then\add* deal with your servants ⸤according to what you see⸥.”\f + \fr 1:13 \ft Literally “and according to/that you see” \f* 
\v 14 So he agreed to this proposal with them, and he tested them \add for\add* ten days. 
\v 15 And at the end of ten days their appearances appeared better and \add they were\add* healthier of body than all the young men who were eating the fine food of the king. 
\v 16 ⸤So⸥\f + \fr 1:16 \ft Literally “And it happened” \f* the guard ⸤continued to withhold⸥\f + \fr 1:16 \ft Literally “he was … withdrawing” \f* their fine food and the wine of their drink, and he gave them\f + \fr 1:16 \ft Hebrew “to them” \f* vegetables.
\p 
\v 17 ⸤And as for these four young men⸥,\f + \fr 1:17 \ft Literally “And these young men, four of them” \f* God\f + \fr 1:17 \ft Hebrew “the God” \f* gave to them knowledge and insight into all literature and wisdom, and Daniel had insight into all visions\f + \fr 1:17 \ft Hebrew “vision” \f* and dreams. 
\v 18 And at the end of the time the king had set to bring them, the commander of the court officials brought them in ⸤before⸥\f + \fr 1:18 \ft Literally “to the face of” \f* Nebuchadnezzar. 
\v 19 And the king spoke with them, ⸤and among all of them no one was found like⸥\f + \fr 1:19 \ft Literally “and he was not found from all of them like” \f* Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; then they stood ⸤before⸥\f + \fr 1:19 \ft Literally “to the face of” \f* the king. 
\v 20 And in every matter of wisdom \add and\add* understanding \add about\add* which the king inquired from them, he found them ten times better \add than\add* all \add of\add* the magicians\f + \fr 1:20 \ft Or “soothsayer-priests” \f* \add and\add* conjurers\f + \fr 1:20 \ft Or “enchanters” \f* that ⸤were in his entire kingdom⸥.\f + \fr 1:20 \ft Literally “in the whole of his kingdom” \f* 
\v 21 And Daniel was \add there\add* until the first year of Cyrus the king.

\s1 The King’s Troubling Dream
\m 
\v 1 Now\f + \fr 2:1 \ft Hebrew “And” \f* in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams; and his spirit was troubled and his sleep left him. 
\v 2 So the king said to call the magicians\f + \fr 2:2 \ft Or “soothsayer-priests” \f* and the conjurers\f + \fr 2:2 \ft Or “enchanters” \f* and the sorcerers and the ⸤astrologers⸥\f + \fr 2:2 \ft Literally “Chaldeans” \f* to tell to the king his dreams. And they came in and they stood ⸤before⸥\f + \fr 2:2 \ft Literally “to the face of” \f* the king. 
\v 3 And the king said to them, “⸤I have had a dream⸥\f + \fr 2:3 \ft Literally “A dream I have dreamed” \f* and my spirit is anxious to know the dream.”
\p 
\v 4 And the ⸤astrologers⸥\f + \fr 2:4 \ft Literally “Chaldeans” \f* said to the king \add in\add* Aramaic,\f + \fr 2:4 \ft The text of Daniel is in Aramaic from this point on through Daniel chapter 7. Then the text resumes in Hebrew to the end of the book \f* “O king, live forever! Tell the dream to your servants and we will reveal the explanation.” 
\v 5 The king answered and said to the ⸤astrologers⸥,\f + \fr 2:5 \ft Literally “Chaldeans” \f* “The command from me is firm: if you \add do\add* not make known to me the dream and its explanation,\f + \fr 2:5 \ft Or “interpretation” \f* \add then\add* you will be broken into pieces and your houses will be laid in ruins. 
\v 6 But if you tell me the dream and its explanation, you will receive gifts and rewards\f + \fr 2:6 \ft Aramaic “reward” \f* and great honor from me. Therefore, tell me the dream and its explanation.”\f + \fr 2:6 \ft Or “interpretation” \f* 
\v 7 They answered once more and said, “Let the king tell the dream to his servants and we will make the explanation known.” 
\v 8 The king answered and said, “⸤Certainly⸥\f + \fr 2:8 \ft Literally “From \fq a \ft certainty” \f* I know that ⸤you are trying to gain time⸥\f + \fr 2:8 \ft Literally “the time you are gaining” \f* ⸤because⸥\f + \fr 2:8 \ft Literally “all because of that” \f* you have seen ⸤that this matter is firmly decreed by me⸥,\f + \fr 2:8 \ft Literally “that firm from me \fq is \ft the decree” \f* 
\v 9 for if you \add do\add* not make the dream known to me, ⸤your verdict is fixed⸥,\f + \fr 2:9 \ft Literally “one is your verdict” \f* and you have conspired to say \add a\add* lying and deceitful word to me until the ⸤circumstances⸥\f + \fr 2:9 \ft Literally “time” \f* will change. Therefore, tell me the dream, and I will know that you can tell me its explanation.” 
\v 10 The ⸤astrologers⸥\f + \fr 2:10 \ft Literally “Chaldeans” \f* answered the king and said, “There is not a man on earth that is able to reveal the word of the king; ⸤in fact⸥,\f + \fr 2:10 \ft Literally “all because that” \f* no great and powerful king has \add ever\add* asked a thing like this of any magician\f + \fr 2:10 \ft Or “soothsayer-priest” \f* or conjurer\f + \fr 2:10 \ft Or “enchanter” \f* or ⸤astrologer⸥.\f + \fr 2:10 \ft Literally “Chaldean” \f* 
\v 11 And the thing that the king is asking \add is too\add* difficult and ⸤there is no one who⸥\f + \fr 2:11 \ft Literally “there is not another” \f* can reveal it to the king except \add the\add* gods ⸤whose dwelling is not with mortals⸥.”\f + \fr 2:11 \ft Literally “concerning their dwelling is not with flesh” \f*
\p 
\v 12 Because of this the king became angry, and he became very much enraged, and he said \add that\add* all the wise men of Babylon \add are\add* to be destroyed. 
\v 13 And the decree was issued, and the wise men ⸤were on the verge of being executed⸥,\f + \fr 2:13 \ft Literally “were in the process of being killed” \f* and they searched for Daniel and his companions to be executed. 
\v 14 Then Daniel responded prudently and discretely to Arioch, the commander of the imperial guard of the king, who had gone out to execute the wise men of Babylon. 
\v 15 ⸤He asked⸥\f + \fr 2:15 \ft Literally “he answered” \f* and said to Arioch, the royal official of the king, “⸤Why⸥\f + \fr 2:15 \ft Literally “Over what” \f* is the decree from the king \add so\add* severe?” Then Arioch explained the matter\f + \fr 2:15 \ft Or “situation” \f* to Daniel. 
\v 16 And Daniel went in and requested from the king that he would give him time, and ⸤he would tell the king⸥\f + \fr 2:16 \ft Literally “to tell/reveal to the king” \f* the explanation.\f + \fr 2:16 \ft Or “interpretation” \f*
\p 
\v 17 Then Daniel went to his home, and he made the matter known to Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, his companions, 
\v 18 and \add told them\add* to seek mercy ⸤from the God of heaven⸥\f + \fr 2:18 \ft Literally “from before the God of the heaven” \f* concerning this mystery, so that Daniel and his companions, along with the remainder of the wise men of Babylon, would not be killed.
\p 
\v 19 Then in a vision of the night the mystery was revealed to Daniel; then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.
\p 
\v 20 Daniel ⸤said⸥:\f + \fr 2:20 \ft Literally “answered and he said” \f*
\sd0
\q1 “Let his name, \add the name\add* of God,\f + \fr 2:20 \ft Aramaic “the God” \f* be blessed ⸤throughout the ages⸥,\f + \fr 2:20 \ft Literally “from the age unto the age” \f*
\q2 for the wisdom and the power ⸤are his⸥.\f + \fr 2:20 \ft Literally “of to him it \fq is \ft ” \f*
\q1 
\v 21 And he changes the times and the seasons,
\q2 and he deposes kings and he sets up kings;
\q1 he gives wisdom\f + \fr 2:21 \ft Aramaic “the wisdom” \f* to wise men
\q2 and knowledge to \add men who\add* know understanding.
\q1 
\v 22 He reveals the deep and the hidden things;
\q2 he knows what \add is\add* in the darkness,
\q2 and the light dwells with him.
\q1 
\v 23 To you, O God of my ancestors,\f + \fr 2:23 \ft Or “fathers” \f*
\q2 I give thanks and I give praises,
\q1 for the wisdom and the power you gave to me,
\q2 and now you have made known to me
\q1 what we have asked from you,
\q2 for you have made known to us the matter of the king.”

\s1 Daniel Praises God and Interprets the King’s Dream
\m 
\v 24 ⸤Therefore⸥\f + \fr 2:24 \ft Literally “Now because this” \f* Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed\f + \fr 2:24 \ft Aramaic “has appointed” \f* to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and thus he said to him: “You must not destroy the wise men of Babylon; take me in before the king and I will give the explanation\f + \fr 2:24 \ft Or “interpretation” \f* to the king.”
\p 
\v 25 Then Arioch ⸤quickly⸥\f + \fr 2:25 \ft Literally “in haste” \f* brought Daniel in before the king and thus he said to him: “I have found a man among ⸤the exiles⸥\f + \fr 2:25 \ft Literally “the children of exiles” \f* of Judah\f + \fr 2:25 \ft Aramaic “Jehud” \f* who ⸤can relate⸥\f + \fr 2:25 \ft Literally “he will make known” \f* the explanation\f + \fr 2:25 \ft Or “interpretation” \f* to the king. 
\v 26 ⸤The king then asked⸥\f + \fr 2:26 \ft Literally “The king answered” \f* and said to Daniel, whose name \add was\add* Belteshazzar, “Are you able to make known to me the dream that I have seen and its explanation?”\f + \fr 2:26 \ft Or “interpretation” \f* 
\v 27 Daniel answered the king and said, “The mystery that the king asks, no wise men, conjurers,\f + \fr 2:27 \ft Or “enchanters” \f* magicians,\f + \fr 2:27 \ft Or “soothsayer-priests” \f* \add or\add* diviners are able to make known to the king. 
\v 28 But there is a God in heaven \add who\add* reveals mysteries, and he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what \add it is\add* that will be at the end of days. This \add is\add* your dream and the visions of your head on your bed.
\p 
\v 29 “\add As for you\add*, king,\f + \fr 2:29 \ft Aramaic “the king” \f* your thoughts on your bed ⸤turned to⸥\f + \fr 2:29 \ft Literally “they went up” \f* what \add it was\add* that would be ⸤in the future⸥,\f + \fr 2:29 \ft Literally “after this” \f* and the revealer of mysteries has made known to you what that would be. 
\v 30 And as for me, \add it is\add* not because of wisdom that is in me more than ⸤any other living person⸥\f + \fr 2:30 \ft Literally “all of living beings” \f* \add that\add* this mystery is revealed to me, but ⸤in order that⸥\f + \fr 2:30 \ft Literally “concerning the matter of” \f* the explanation\f + \fr 2:30 \ft Or “interpretation” \f* may be made known to the king and you will ⸤understand⸥\f + \fr 2:30 \ft Literally “know” \f* the thoughts of your ⸤mind⸥.\f + \fr 2:30 \ft Literally “heart” \f*
\p 
\v 31 “You, O king, were looking and, look, there was one great statue. This statue \add was\add* huge and its brilliance extraordinary, standing \add there\add* before you, and its appearance \add was\add* frightening.\f + \fr 2:31 \ft Or “dreadful” \f* 
\v 32 The head of this statue \add was\add* of fine gold, its chest and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of bronze, 
\v 33 its legs of iron, its feet, part of them of iron and part of them of clay. 
\v 34 You were looking on ⸤until⸥\f + \fr 2:34 \ft Literally “until that” \f* a stone was chiseled out\f + \fr 2:34 \ft Or “became loose” \f*—that not by hands—and it struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay, and it broke them in pieces. 
\v 35 Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold ⸤all at once⸥\f + \fr 2:35 \ft Literally “like one” \f* broke into pieces\f + \fr 2:35 \ft Or “were crushed” \f* and they became like chaff from the summer threshing floor, and the wind carried them away and any trace of them could not be found. But the stone that struck the statue became a great mountain and it filled the whole earth.
\p 
\v 36 “This \add was\add* the dream, and \add now\add* we will tell its interpretation to the king. 
\v 37 You, O king, the king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power and the might and the glory, 
\v 38 and \add also\add* ⸤human beings wherever they dwell⸥,\f + \fr 2:38 \ft Literally “and into all that dwell sons of humankind” \f* the animals of the field and the birds\f + \fr 2:38 \ft Aramaic “bird” \f* of heaven\f + \fr 2:38 \ft Or “the sky” \f*—he has given into your hand and made you ruler over all of them—you are the head of gold. 
\v 39 And after you another kingdom inferior to yours will arise, and another third \add kingdom\add* of bronze that will rule over the whole earth. 
\v 40 And \add a\add* fourth kingdom will be strong as iron, \add and\add* ⸤just as⸥\f + \fr 2:40 \ft Literally “all of because” \f* iron crushes and smashes ⸤everything⸥,\f + \fr 2:40 \ft Literally “the whole thing” \f* and as iron shatters all of these \add other metals\add*, \add so\add* it will crush and it will shatter \add these nations\add*. 
\v 41 ⸤And just as⸥\f + \fr 2:41 \ft Literally “And that” \f* you saw the feet and the toes, ⸤partly potter’s clay⸥\f + \fr 2:41 \ft Literally “from them clay of the potter” \f* and ⸤partly iron⸥,\f + \fr 2:41 \ft Literally “from them iron” \f* it will be a divided kingdom; and ⸤some hardness⸥\f + \fr 2:41 \ft Literally “from the hardness” \f* of the iron will be \add in it\add*, ⸤just as⸥\f + \fr 2:41 \ft Literally “all of because that” \f* you have seen the iron mixed with the wet clay. 
\v 42 And \add as\add* the toes of the feet \add were\add* partly iron and partly clay, \add so\add* part of the kingdom will be strong ⸤and partly brittle⸥.\f + \fr 2:42 \ft Literally “and from it, it will be brittle” \f* 
\v 43 And \add in\add* that you saw the iron was mixed with wet clay, \add so\add* ⸤they will mix in marriage⸥\f + \fr 2:43 \ft Literally “mixing they will in the seed of man” \f* and they will not cling ⸤to one another⸥,\f + \fr 2:43 \ft Literally “this one with that one” \f* just as iron \add does\add* not mix with clay. 
\v 44 And ⸤in the day of those kings⸥,\f + \fr 2:44 \ft Literally “in their days of those kings” \f* the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will ⸤never⸥\f + \fr 2:44 \ft Literally “to forever not” \f* be destroyed, and the kingdom will not be left for another nation,\f + \fr 2:44 \ft Or “people” \f* and it will bring an end to all these kingdoms, but it will stand ⸤forever⸥.\f + \fr 2:44 \ft Literally “to eternity” \f* 
\v 45 ⸤Inasmuch as⸥\f + \fr 2:45 \ft Literally “All of because that” \f* you saw that a stone from the mountain was chiseled out\f + \fr 2:45 \ft Or “became loose” \f* \add but\add* not by hands, and \add that\add* it crushed the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver and the gold, \add thereby\add* the great God made known to the king what will be ⸤in the future⸥,\f + \fr 2:45 \ft Literally “after this” \f* and the dream is certain and its explanation trustworthy.”
\s1 The King’s Response to Daniel and His God
\m 
\v 46 Then the king, Nebuchadnezzar, fell on his face and he paid homage to Daniel; and he commanded \add them\add* to offer \add a\add* grain offering and incense offering to him. 
\v 47 The king answered Daniel and said, “⸤Truly⸥\f + \fr 2:47 \ft Literally “From truth that” \f* your God \add is\add* the God of gods and the Lord of kings, and he reveals mysteries, for you are able to reveal this mystery.” 
\v 48 Then the king promoted Daniel and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and the chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon. 
\v 49 And Daniel made a request from the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego over the affairs of the province of Babylon, while Daniel \add remained\add* in the court of the king.

\m 
\v 1 Nebuchadnezzar the king made a statue of gold. Its height \add was\add* sixty cubits \add and\add* its width \add was\add* six cubits; he set it up in the valley of Dura in the province of Babylon. 
\v 2 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent \add directions\add* to assemble the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates and all of the officials of the provinces to come to the dedication of the statue that Nebuchadnezzar the king \add had\add* set up. 
\v 3 Then the satraps, the prefects, the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates, and all the officials of the province \add were\add* assembled for the dedication of the statue that Nebuchadnezzar the king \add had\add* set up, and \add were\add* standing ⸤before⸥\f + \fr 3:3 \ft Literally “to \fq the \ft front” \f* the statue that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.

\v 14 And I have heard that a spirit of the gods \add is\add* in you and enlightenment and insight and excellent wisdom was found in you. 
\v 15 And now the wise men \add and\add* the conjurers\f + \fr 5:15 \ft Or “enchanters” \f* were brought in before me \add so\add* that they could read this writing \add in order to\add* make its explanation\f + \fr 5:15 \ft Or “interpretation” \f* known to me, but they were not able to disclose the explanation\f + \fr 5:15 \ft Or “interpretation” \f* of the matter. 
\v 16 But I have heard concerning you that you are able ⸤to produce interpretations⸥\f + \fr 5:16 \ft Literally “to interpret interpretations” \f* and to solve riddles; now if you are able to read the writing and to make known its explanation\f + \fr 5:16 \ft Or “interpretation” \f* to me, you will be clothed \add in\add* purple and \add a\add* necklace of gold \add will be placed\add* around your neck and you will rule \add as\add* third \add in command\add* in the kingdom.”
\p 
\v 17 Then Daniel answered and said before the king, “Let your gifts be for yourself or your rewards give to another; nevertheless, I will read the writing to the king and I will make known to him the explanation.\f + \fr 5:17 \ft Or “interpretation” \f* 
\v 18 ⸤O king⸥,\f + \fr 5:18 \ft Literally “You, O king” \f* the Most High God gave the kingdom and the greatness and the glory and the majesty to Nebuchadnezzar your ⸤predecessor⸥.\f + \fr 5:18 \ft Literally “father” \f* 
\v 19 And because of the greatness that he gave to him, all the peoples, the nations and languages trembled and feared before him; whomever he wanted he killed, and whomever he wanted he let live, and whomever he wanted he honored, and whomever he wanted he humbled. 
\v 20 But ⸤when⸥\f + \fr 5:20 \ft Literally “as that” \f* his heart became arrogant and his spirit became hard \add so as\add* to act proudly, he was deposed from the throne of his kingdom and the\f + \fr 5:20 \ft Or “his” \f* glory ⸤was taken away from him⸥.\f + \fr 5:20 \ft Literally “they took away” \f* 
\v 21 And he was driven away ⸤from human society⸥\f + \fr 5:21 \ft Literally “from the sons of the humankind” \f* and his mind was made like the animals\f + \fr 5:21 \ft Aramaic “with the animals” \f* and his dwelling \add was\add* with the wild asses; \add and\add* ⸤he was given⸥\f + \fr 5:21 \ft Literally “they gave him” \f* grass like oxen to eat, and with\f + \fr 5:21 \ft Aramaic “from” \f* the dew of heaven his body was bathed, until he acknowledged that the Most High God \add is\add* sovereign over the kingdom of humankind, and ⸤whoever⸥\f + \fr 5:21 \ft Literally “to from that” \f* he wants he sets over it.
\p 
\v 22 “But you his ⸤successor⸥,\f + \fr 5:22 \ft Literally “son” \f* Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart ⸤even though⸥\f + \fr 5:22 \ft Literally “all of because that” \f* you knew all this. 
\v 23 And \add now\add* you have exalted yourself against the Lord of heaven, and the vessels of his temple you have brought in before you, and you and your lords,\f + \fr 5:23 \ft Or “nobles” \f* your wives and your concubines, have been drinking wine from\f + \fr 5:23 \ft Aramaic “with” \f* them, and you have praised the gods of silver, gold, bronze, iron, wood, and stone\f + \fr 5:23 \ft All the materials in this list have the definite article that does not have to be translated into English \f* that \add do\add* not see and \add do\add* not hear and \add do\add* not know, but the God ⸤who holds your life in his hand⸥\f + \fr 5:23 \ft Literally “who your breath \fq is \ft in his hand” \f* and all of your ways ⸤come from him⸥,\f + \fr 5:23 \ft Literally “\fq belong \ft to him” \f* you have not honored. 
\v 24 So then the palm of the hand was sent out from his presence and this writing was inscribed.
\p 
\v 25 “Now this was the writing that was inscribed: ‘Mene, Mene, Tekel and Parsin.’
\p 
\v 26 “This \add is\add* the explanation of the matter:\f + \fr 5:26 \ft Or “word, message” \f* ‘Mene’—God has numbered your kingdom and brought an end \add to\add* it.
\p 
\v 27 “ ‘Tekel’—you have been weighed on scales and you have been found wanting.\f + \fr 5:27 \ft Or “deficient” \f*
\p 
\v 28 “ ‘Peres’—your kingdom has been divided and given to \add the\add* Medes and Persians.’ ”
\p 
\v 29 Then Belshazzar commanded, and they clothed Daniel \add with\add* purple and \add placed\add* a necklace of gold around his neck, and they made a proclamation concerning him that he would be \add the\add* third ruler \add in authority\add* in the kingdom. 
\v 30 ⸤That same night⸥\f + \fr 5:30 \ft Literally “In it, in the night” \f* Belshazzar, the Chaldean king, was killed. 
\v 31 \f + \fr 5:31 \ft \xt Daniel 5:31–6:28 \ft in the English Bible is 6:1–29 in the Hebrew Bible \f* And Darius the Mede received the kingdom ⸤when he was about sixty-two years old⸥.\f + \fr 5:31 \ft Literally “when a son of sixty and two years” \f*
\c 6
\s1 Daniel’s Integrity and His Entrapment by His Enemies
\m 
\v 1 ⸤It pleased Darius⸥,\f + \fr 6:1 \ft Literally “It was pleasant before Darius” \f* and he set up one hundred and twenty satraps over the kingdom, that they were ⸤throughout the whole kingdom⸥,\f + \fr 6:1 \ft Literally “in all the kingdom” \f* 
\v 2 and over them \add were\add* three administrators, \add of\add* whom Daniel \add was\add* one, \add so\add* that these satraps were giving account to them, and the king would not be suffering loss. 
\v 3 Then Daniel ⸤began distinguishing himself⸥\f + \fr 6:3 \ft Literally “was distinguishing himself” \f* above the administrators and the satraps ⸤because⸥\f + \fr 6:3 \ft Literally “all of because that” \f* an exceptional spirit \add was\add* in him, and \add so\add* the king planned to appoint him over the whole kingdom. 
\v 4 Then the \add other\add* administrators and satraps ⸤began to seek⸥\f + \fr 6:4 \ft Literally “were seeking” \f* to find \add a\add* pretext against Daniel ⸤in connection with the kingdom⸥,\f + \fr 6:4 \ft Literally “from the side of the kingdom” \f* but they were not able to find any pretext and ⸤corruption⸥\f + \fr 6:4 \ft Literally “being corrupt” \f* ⸤because⸥\f + \fr 6:4 \ft Literally “all because that” \f* he was trustworthy, and no\f + \fr 6:4 \ft Aramaic “any” \f* negligence or ⸤corruption⸥\f + \fr 6:4 \ft Literally “being corrupt” \f* ⸤could be found in him⸥.\f + \fr 6:4 \ft Literally “not could be found” \f* 
\v 5 Then these men ⸤said⸥,\f + \fr 6:5 \ft Literally “\fq were \ft saying” \f* “We will not find any pretext\f + \fr 6:5 \ft Or “basis for accusation” \f* against this Daniel unless we find it in connection with the law of his God.”
\p 
\v 6 So the administrators and the satraps conspired ⸤with respect to⸥\f + \fr 6:6 \ft Literally “on/upon” \f* the king and so they said to him, “Darius, O king, live ⸤forever⸥!\f + \fr 6:6 \ft Literally “to eternity” \f* 
\v 7 All of \add the\add* administrators of the kingdom, and the prefects, the satraps, the counselors and the governors took counsel \add and have\add* agreed to establish an edict of the king and to enforce a decree that ⸤whoever⸥\f + \fr 6:7 \ft Literally “all that” \f* will seek a prayer from any god or human except from you \add for\add* up to thirty days will be thrown into ⸤the lion pit⸥.\f + \fr 6:7 \ft Literally “pit of lions” \f* 
\v 8 Now, O king, establish the edict and you must sign the document \add so\add* that \add it\add* cannot be changed, according to \add the\add* law of \add the\add* Medes and Persians which cannot be revoked.”
\p 
\v 9 ⸤So⸥\f + \fr 6:9 \ft Literally “Like to before this” \f* the king, Darius, signed the writing and the interdict.\f + \fr 6:9 \ft Or “the writing that is the interdict” \f* 
\v 10 Now ⸤when⸥\f + \fr 6:10 \ft Literally “as that” \f* Daniel realized that the document was signed, he went to his house (⸤now he had windows in his upper room that were open⸥\f + \fr 6:10 \ft Literally “and windows were open to him in his upper room” \f* toward Jerusalem), and three times ⸤daily⸥\f + \fr 6:10 \ft Literally “in the day” \f* he knelt on his knees and prayed and \add gave\add* praise before his God, ⸤just as⸥\f + \fr 6:10 \ft Literally “all because that” \f* he had been doing ⸤previously⸥.\f + \fr 6:10 \ft Literally “from before this” \f* 
\v 11 Then these men came as a group and they found Daniel praying and pleading for mercy before his God. 
\v 12 Then they approached ⸤and spoke with the king⸥\f + \fr 6:12 \ft Literally “and saying before the king” \f* concerning the edict of the king, “⸤Did you not sign an edict⸥\f + \fr 6:12 \ft Literally “Not an edict you signed?” \f* that any person who would seek \add anything\add* from any God or human within thirty days except from you, O king, would be thrown into ⸤the lion pit⸥?”\f + \fr 6:12 \ft Literally “pit of lions” \f* The king answered and said, “The matter \add as you have just stated\add* is certain according to \add the\add* law of \add the\add* Medes and Persians which cannot be revoked.”
\s1 God’s Miraculous Deliverance of Daniel Again
\m 
\v 13 Then ⸤they responded⸥\f + \fr 6:13 \ft Literally “they answered” \f* and said before the king, “Daniel, who \add is\add* from ⸤the exiles⸥\f + \fr 6:13 \ft Literally “the sons of the exile” \f* of Judah,\f + \fr 6:13 \ft Aramaic “Jehud” \f* ⸤is not paying any attention⸥\f + \fr 6:13 \ft Literally “not he sets \fq his mind \ft ” \f* to you, O king, or to the decree that you have signed, ⸤and three times daily⸥\f + \fr 6:13 \ft Literally “and three times on the day” \f* he says his prayer.” 
\v 14 Then the king, when\f + \fr 6:14 \ft Aramaic “as ” \f* he heard that ⸤report⸥,\f + \fr 6:14 \ft Literally “word” \f* he was extremely distressed over it; and ⸤concerning Daniel⸥\f + \fr 6:14 \ft Literally “upon Daniel” \f* ⸤he was determined⸥\f + \fr 6:14 \ft Literally “he set \fq his \ft heart” \f* to rescue him.

\v 15 Then these men came as \add a\add* group to the king and ⸤said⸥,\f + \fr 6:15 \ft Literally “saying” \f* “Recall, O king, that \add with respect to\add* \add the\add* law of\f + \fr 6:15 \ft Aramaic “to” \f* \add the\add* Medes and Persians that ⸤any⸥\f + \fr 6:15 \ft Literally “all/every” \f* decree or edict that the king establishes cannot be changed.”
\p 
\v 16 Then the king gave the command, and Daniel was brought in and they threw \add him\add* into ⸤the lion pit⸥.\f + \fr 6:16 \ft Literally “pit of lions” \f* ⸤The king said⸥\f + \fr 6:16 \ft Literally “The king answered and saying” \f* to Daniel, “Your God, whom you serve ⸤faithfully⸥,\f + \fr 6:16 \ft Literally “in the loyalty” \f* may he rescue you!” 
\v 17 And a\f + \fr 6:17 \ft Aramaic “one” \f* stone was brought and it was put on the entrance of the pit, and the king sealed it with his signet \add ring\add* and with the signet \add rings\add* of his lords,\f + \fr 6:17 \ft Or “nobles” \f* so that nothing would be changed concerning Daniel. 
\v 18 Then the king went to his palace and spent the night in fasting, and no food was brought in before him and his sleep fled from him.
\p 
\v 19 Then the king got up at daybreak, at first light, and he went ⸤in haste⸥\f + \fr 6:19 \ft Literally “to hasten” \f* to ⸤the lion pit⸥.\f + \fr 6:19 \ft Literally “pit of lions” \f*

\v 21 Then Daniel spoke to\f + \fr 6:21 \ft Aramaic “with” \f* the king, “O king, live ⸤forever⸥!\f + \fr 6:21 \ft Literally “unto endless ages” \f* 
\v 22 My God sent his angel and he shut the mouth of the lions and they did not\f + \fr 6:22 \ft Aramaic “would not” \f* hurt me, ⸤because⸥\f + \fr 6:22 \ft Literally “all of because that” \f* before him ⸤I was found⸥\f + \fr 6:22 \ft Literally “it was found for me” \f* blameless, and also before you, O king, I have not done \add any\add* wrong.”

\v 24 The king then commanded, and these men were brought ⸤who had accused Daniel⸥,\f + \fr 6:24 \ft Literally “they ate his pieces of Daniel” \f* and they threw them and their children and their wives into ⸤the lion pit⸥,\f + \fr 6:24 \ft Literally “pit of lions” \f* and they had not reached the floor of the pit ⸤before⸥\f + \fr 6:24 \ft Literally “until that” \f* the lions had overpowered them and they had crushed all of their bones.
\s1 The King Praises the God of Daniel and Daniel Prospers

\v 25 Then Darius the king wrote to all the people, the nations, and the languages living in the whole earth, “May your prosperity become great!

\v 1 In the first year of Belshazzar the king of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream and visions\f + \fr 7:1 \ft Or “the visions” \f* of his head \add as he lay\add* on his bed; then he wrote down the dream \add and\add* \add the\add* ⸤summary⸥\f + \fr 7:1 \ft Literally “head” \f* of \add the\add* words ⸤as follows⸥:\f + \fr 7:1 \ft Literally “saying” \f*
